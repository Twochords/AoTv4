# Validate the EQUI_*.xml files we ship before copying them into the client.
#
# WHY: the RoF2 SIDL parser aborts the ENTIRE file on one bad token and the client then CRASHES at
# UI load, with only "ParseNodeList() SyntaxError" in <EQ>/UIErrorLog.txt to go on -- and the line it
# names is where it gave up, not where the mistake is. This has cost two debugging sessions already,
# both times a double hyphen inside an XML comment.
#
# There is no xmllint/python/node in this container, so these are hand-rolled checks:
#   1. double hyphen inside an XML comment  (illegal XML; the actual killer both times)
#   2. unbalanced tags
#   3. every <Pieces> target is defined in the same file
#   4. modern-only tags RoF2-shipped UI files never use (<Sortable>, column <Tooltip>)
#

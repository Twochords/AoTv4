# AoTv4 — All-Classes Random-Progression EQ Server

EQEmu server + RoF2 client mod. The headline feature is a **level-up reward window**: on each
level you're offered **3 random rewards** (spells or class-specific combat abilities) and pick
one, which the server scribes/trains. The window is drawn by a client-side `dinput8.dll`
so it works on a **vanilla RoF2 client — no MacroQuest/E3 required**.

> **⚠️ ALL CLASSES (was Bard-only).** Originally every character was forced to Bard; as of **2026-07**
> the server is opened to **all 16 classes**. The four pure-melee classes (Warrior/Monk/Rogue/Berserker)
> are turned into casters **client-side** by the dll (`core_allcasters`, §14) + **server-side** mana
> (`CalcMaxMana`). The reward-pool spells are opened to every class, and the reward abilities cast as
> **spells not songs** even for a Bard (client `IsBardSong` detour, §14). Sections below that still say
> "everyone is a Bard" are **historical** — Bard is now just one of the 16. Existing pre-pivot characters
> remain Bard (a valid class; no forced reclass).

## 0. Version control — THREE separate git repos, and the parent ignores two of them

`/src` is its own repo, but **`.devcontainer/.gitignore` has `repo/`**, so the two most valuable trees
are NOT in it — they are independent nested clones with their own remotes and branches:

| Tree | Repo / remote | Branch holding AoTv4 work |
|---|---|---|
| `/src` (server C++, SQL, docs) | this repo | `aotv4-spell-rebuild` |
| `.devcontainer/repo/eq-core-dll` (the **dll**) | `Twochords/Dinput` | `aotv4-advloot-module` |
| `.devcontainer/repo/quests` (**all Lua**) | clone of `ProjectEQ/projecteqquests` | `aotv4` |

⚠️ **`git status` in `/src` tells you NOTHING about the dll or the Lua.** As of 2026-07-25 every AoTv4
Lua module (`spell_choice`, `aa_choice`, `aa_pool`, `era_system`, `pok_travel`, `bazaar_broker`, the
43xxx spell scripts…) had **never been committed anywhere**, and the dll had nothing since the
`tradeskill window` commit. Both now have a first recovery point on the branches above (local commits,
not pushed). **`cd` into each repo and check it separately before assuming work is safe.**

## 1. Environment & layout

- `/src` (dev container) == `C:\AoTv3\AoTv4` (Windows, 9p mount). The EQ **client** is a
  separate RoF2 install on Windows; the dev container holds the **server + sources**.
- Server build/run dir: `/src/build/bin` (config symlinked from `.devcontainer/override/`).
- **Server C++ source:** `/src/zone`, `/src/world`, `/src/common`, … (rebuildable; see §8).
- Quests / Lua: `/src/.devcontainer/repo/quests/` (symlinked into `build/bin/quests`).
  - `quests/global/global_player.lua` — global player event hooks.
  - `quests/lua_modules/` — `spell_choice.lua` (core logic), `spell_pool.lua` (gen),
    `spell_icons.lua` (gen), `skill_pool.lua` (combat-ability rewards), `spell_blacklist.lua` (gen).
- Client mod source: `/src/.devcontainer/repo/eq-core-dll/` (builds `dinput8.dll`).
  - `core_spellwindow.cpp` — the spell window, the **AA window** (§6), the **Portal window** (§11),
    **and** the skill-unlock hook; all share the `dsp_chat` + `ProcessGameEvents` detours.
  - `core_skillunlock.h` — declares `EnableSkillUnlock()` (impl is in `core_spellwindow.cpp`).
  - `core_allcasters.cpp` / `core_allcasters.h` — the **all-classes-as-casters** patch (§14). Its OWN
    translation unit + OWN dedicated detours; NOT piggy-backed on the spell-window / tradeskill hooks.
  - `_options.h` — feature flags; `core_init.h` — wires them in `InitOptions()`.

## 2. Running the server

The stack is 5 processes, started from `/src/build/bin`:

```bash
cd /src/build/bin
nohup ./loginserver  > logs/loginserver_manual.log 2>&1 &
nohup ./world        > logs/world_manual.log       2>&1 &
nohup ./eqlaunch zone> logs/eqlaunch_manual.log     2>&1 &   # zone launcher (boots zones on demand)
nohup ./ucs          > logs/ucs_manual.log          2>&1 &   # chat/mail/bazaar-trader search
nohup ./queryserv    > logs/queryserv_manual.log    2>&1 &   # logging
```

- **"Server down" but you reach char select:** `eqlaunch` isn't running → world logs
  `No zoneserver available to boot up`. Restart `eqlaunch zone`. Keep **exactly one** eqlaunch.
- Zones are **dynamic**: `eqlaunch` boots `./zone` processes on demand and respawns them; idle
  zones self-terminate. That's normal, not a crash.

### RoF2 login needs 5999/udp PUBLISHED (client "times out at username/password")
The RoF2 client logs in on the **SoD stream** (`login.json` `sod_port: 5999`), NOT the Titanium
port 5998. The dev container reaches the Windows client only through `devcontainer.json`
**`appPort`**, which therefore **MUST include `"5999:5999/udp"`** (alongside 5998 world-link,
7000-7005 zones, 9000 world). If it's missing, the loginserver runs fine and world connects, but
the client's login packets never reach the container → **timeout at the username/password screen**
with **zero client lines in `logs/loginserver_manual.log`** (that empty log is the tell). Diagnose:
`(ss -lunp | grep :5999)` shows the loginserver bound locally, but the port isn't forwarded to the
host. Fix = `appPort` entry + a container rebuild. Client `eqhost.txt` stays `Host=127.0.0.1:5999`.

### The DB and the login port both survive rebuilds now (persistent volume)
A container rebuild used to wipe **both** the `peq` database (datadir was on the ephemeral overlay)
and the 5999 port (missing from `appPort`) — the recurring "server won't come up after a rebuild"
pain. Both are fixed in `devcontainer.json`: `appPort` includes `5999:5999/udp`, and the MariaDB
datadir is a **named volume** (`source=aotv4-mysql-data,target=/var/lib/mysql,type=volume`) that
**persists across rebuilds**. See `POST_REBUILD_RECOVERY.md`. The canonical DB snapshot lives at
**`/src/aotv4_current.sql`** (full `peq` with all migrations baked in) — needed only for the ONE
import after the volume is first created, or to seed a brand-new volume; routine rebuilds keep the DB.

## 3. The level-up reward window

No opcode patching — communication rides on **chat**:

```
LEVEL UP
  server (Lua) ──► client : "SPELLCHOICEDATA name1|icon1^name2|icon2^name3|icon3"
                            (server keeps the real ids/types in a data bucket, keyed by char)
  dinput8.dll  ── swallows that line, shows a layered GDI window with 3 rows + icons
  player clicks "Select N"
  dinput8.dll  ──► server : "/say spellpick N"     (this echo is also swallowed)
  server (Lua) ── event_say validates N against the stored bucket, then scribes a spell /
                  trains a discipline / raises a combat skill
```

The **id list is server-side**; the player only sends an **index 1-3**, so a modified client
can't grant an arbitrary reward — only one of the three it was actually offered.

### Server side (Lua)
- `global_player.lua`: `event_connect` sends `SKILLUNLOCKDATA` (see §4) — the old **Bard-force is REMOVED**
  (all classes now, §14); `event_level_up` auto-grants non-combat skills then calls `spell_choice.offer(e)`;
  `event_say` calls `spell_choice.handle_say(e)`.
- `spell_choice.lua` — builds the 3 choices (spells + ~1 combat skill), emits `SPELLCHOICEDATA`,
  validates picks. Stored bucket tokens are **typed**: `S:<spellid>` (spell/disc) or
  `K:<skillid>` (combat skill). Tunables at top: `CHOICE_COUNT`, `LEVEL_BAND`, `SAY_TRIGGER`,
  `SKILL_OFFER_CHANCE` (**0.125** -- roughly one level in eight; it sat at **0.0** for a while, meaning
  combat abilities were never offered at all, while this line still claimed 0.7), `SKILL_GRANT_PCT` (0.25).
- `spell_pool.lua` (**generated**, see §5), `spell_icons.lua` (**generated**),
  `spell_blacklist.lua` (**generated**), `skill_pool.lua` (hand-curated; see §4).

### Client side (`core_spellwindow.cpp` → `dinput8.dll`)
Gated by `areSpellChoiceWindowEnabled` (`_options.h`). RoF2, image base `0x400000`, addresses
rebased at runtime:
- **Chat hook** — detour `CEverQuest::dsp_chat` (`0x51F1A0`): swallow `SPELLCHOICEDATA`,
  `SKILLUNLOCKDATA`, and the `spellpick` echo; parse `name|icon`.
- **Per-frame heartbeat** — detour `ProcessGameEvents` (`0x539E60`, main thread): spawn the
  overlay thread once, and run the pick **on the game thread** via `CEverQuest::InterpretCmd`
  (`0x51FCE0`) → `/say spellpick N`.
- **Window** — a separate **layered, top-most GDI window** on its own thread. We do NOT draw
  through EQ's D3D device: the RoF2 client renders via EQGraphicsDX9.dll's own device, which
  shares no vtable with any device we can create, so Present/swap-chain hooks never fire
  (proven empirically: `present=0 swap=0` with all vtables patched). Works in **windowed mode**.
  Draggable by the title strip; NOT `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` (a click takes focus so EQ stops
  mouse-look → dragging doesn't rotate the camera); shown only while EQ or the overlay itself
  is the **foreground** window (so it never floats over other apps).
- **Icons** — decode `uifiles/default/spellsNN.tga` (own TGA loader: type 2 + RLE 10, 24/32-bit).
  Mapping: `sheet = icon/36 + 1`, `cell = icon%36`, columns = `sheetWidth/40`, cell 40×40.

### The picker is now a NATIVE SIDL window (2026-07-25) — `core_spellchoice_native.cpp`
The GDI overlay above is superseded (it stays in the dll but is never shown). Own TU, no detours of
its own; our `dsp_chat` calls `SpellChoiceParseTransport`. Wire format is **unchanged**
(`SPELLCHOICEDATA` / `SPELLDESCDATA` / `/say spellpick N`) so the server needed no edits.
- **Layout = three "cards"** (icon, name, one-line summary, button) over a shared STML description
  pane — NOT a listbox: a listbox can't carry a per-row icon here, and its column header + red
  selection bar looked nothing like EQ. Two-step commit (Select previews → Confirm learns), because
  a mis-clicked level reward can't be undone.
- ⚠️ **Per-row icons in a SIDL window — the trick.** This build maps **no** runtime icon API:
  `CTextureAnimation::SetCurCell`, `CSidlManager::FindAnimation` and `CListWnd::SetItemIcon` are all
  absent from `eqgame.h` (only `GetItemIcon` exists), so a texture cell **cannot be chosen from
  code**. Instead the choice moves into the XML: one `Ui2DAnimation` per icon (already pointing at
  the right cell of the right `SpellsNN.tga`) + **one hidden Button per (row, icon)** carrying an
  **inline `<ButtonDrawTemplate>`** (the form stock `EQUI_Inventory.xml` uses for its icon buttons);
  the dll just `Show()`s the matching one, and `CXWnd::Show` **is** mapped.
  Generated by **`aotv4_client_install/gen_choice_xml.pl`**, which **reads the icon set out of
  `spell_icons.lua` + `skill_pool.lua`** rather than hardcoding it → `EQUI_AoTSpellChoiceWnd.xml`
  (~8600 lines, 154 icons, 471 pieces). **Rerun it whenever the pool is regenerated.**
  The dll keeps **no** copy of the icon list: it looks the button up by name at runtime
  (`ASC_Icon<row>_<icon>`), so the XML is the single source of truth and an undefined icon just
  draws nothing. (An earlier `kIcons[]` array had to match the generator exactly and drifted the
  moment the pool changed from 22 icons to 154.) Same trick applies to any window wanting icons.
- ⚠️ **Only `Spells01..Spells07` are declared** in the client's `EQUI_Animations.xml`, so icon
  indices **above 251** have no texture and are skipped by the generator (1 spell in the stock pool).
- ⚠️⚠️ **Texture names in SIDL are CASE SENSITIVE, and `/src/EQUI_Animations.xml` is the authority.**
  A `<Texture>` is resolved against the texture registry built from that file's ~588 `<TextureInfo>`
  entries — **not** against the filesystem. The spell sheets are declared **`Spells01.tga`** (capital
  S, 256×256, `A_SpellIcons` is the stock `Grid` animation over them with `CellWidth/CellHeight` 40).
  Writing `spells01.tga` resolves to **nothing**: the button is created, found and shown, but draws
  an empty hole — **no `UIErrorLog.txt` entry, no error anywhere**. This cost a full round trip; it
  is invisible to every check we have, so grep `EQUI_Animations.xml` for the exact spelling before
  referencing any texture. (Our GDI loaders get away with lowercase because they open the file
  through Windows, which is not case sensitive — so a name that works there can still fail in SIDL.)

  sensitive — a name that works there can still fail in SIDL.)
- Verify a SIDL tag exists before using it: `strings -n 3 eqgame.exe | grep -qx "<Tag>"`
  (`Ui2DAnimation`/`Frames`/`Texture`/`Hotspot`/`Cycle`/`Duration`/`PressedFlyby` all pass;
  `Cell` does not). Then `aotv4_client_install/validate_ui_xml.sh` before copying.
- **Ctrl+Q**: opens the native picker when a reward is pending, else the old Reward Journal on its
  **Lost** tab — the journal's Spell and AA tabs are dead (this module owns `SPELLCHOICEDATA`, and
  random AA is retired: `areAAChoiceWindowEnabled=false`, the `AACHOICEDATA` line is parsed and
  swallowed but shows nothing).
- ✅ **The "You Lost" death window is now a native SIDL window** (2026-07-27) —
  `core_lostwindow.cpp/.h` + `EQUI_AoTLostWnd.xml`, its OWN translation unit like `core_advloot`.
  Installs no detours; our `dsp_chat` calls `LostParseTransport` (swallows `LOSTDATA`), Ctrl+Q calls
  `LostWindowShow`, and the `CleanGameUI`/`ReloadUI` detour that `core_achievements_native.cpp` owns
  calls `LostWindowOnUiReset`. **Wire format unchanged** (`LOSTDATA name^name^…`) so the server was
  not touched. Scrolling, dragging and the 45-second idle timeout are all gone — the UI engine does
  the first two and a real window with a close box does not need the third, so the list now stays
  until dismissed. The GDI `PaintLostOverlay`/`LostOverlayWndProc`/`LostOverlayThreadProc` remain in
  `core_spellwindow.cpp` but are **unreachable** (`if (false && …)`); delete once confirmed working.
  Install: `aotv4_client_install/LOST_WINDOW_INSTALL.md`.
  - ✅ **It is the "Death Book" and the dates EXPAND** (2026-07-28). One header row per death —
    `[+]`/`[-]`, date, killer, item count — and only an open one lists its items, so 400 entries read
    as a table of contents rather than a wall of names. The newest death starts open.
    ⚠️ **`LostBuildGroups` resets the open/closed state**, so it is called only where the DATA is
    replaced (`LOSTDATA`, and the LAST `LOSTLOG` chunk), never from `Refresh()` — and never on a
    partial log, which would split one death across two chunks into two dates.
    ⚠️⚠️ **The toggle is DEFERRED to `LostWindowTick`, not done in the click handler.** Toggling calls
    `Refresh` → `DeleteAll`, which would destroy the listbox's rows from inside the listbox's own
    notification while the client is still walking them. ⚠️ The selection is also read *after*
    `CSidlScreenWnd::WndNotification` has run — inside it, `GetCurSel` is still one click behind.
    ⚠️ Row index is NOT a data index (headers interleave, a closed death hides many rows) — every
    click goes through the explicit `g_rowGroup[]` map.
- ✅ **The Search window is now a native SIDL window and is called "Allaclone"** (2026-07-28) —
  `core_allaclone.cpp/.h` + `EQUI_AoTAllacloneWnd.xml`, its OWN translation unit like `core_advloot`.
  Installs no detours; our `dsp_chat` calls `AllacloneParseTransport` (swallows `SRCHDATA`/`SRCHDET`)
  and `AllacloneIsOurEcho`, `ProcessGameEvents` calls `AllacloneTick`, and the `CleanGameUI`/
  `ReloadUI` detour that `core_achievements_native.cpp` owns calls `AllacloneOnUiReset`.
  **Wire format unchanged** (`/say srch <kind> <term>`, `/say srchdet <kind> <id>`) so the server was
  not touched at all — `Client::SearchList`/`SearchDetail` are as they were.
  Command is **`/allaclone`**, with `/search` and `/find` kept as aliases; the AoT menu button is
  relabelled. `EnableSearchWindow()`/`ShowSearchWindow()` in `core_spellwindow.cpp` are now
  **forwarders** so the switch is one place instead of a rename through every caller, and
  `g_searchEnabled` stays false, which makes the old overlay's thread/paint/chat handler unreachable
  without deleting them yet.
  - ⚠️ **NO `TabBox` here, deliberately.** Native tabs are the right widget when each page owns its
    contents; the four kinds (item/npc/spell/recipe) share ONE search box, ONE list and ONE detail
    pane, so tabs would mean four copies of each. They are **mode buttons**, and the active one is
    shown by rewriting its LABEL (`> Items <`) because no latched button state can be set reliably
    from code on this build.
  - ⚠️ **Enter is POLLED, not hooked.** An `Editbox` gives no usable "text committed" notification
    here, so `AllacloneTick` watches the box and searches once the text settles (450 ms) — the same
    approach the AdvLoot filter box already uses. ⚠️ An empty box must still be RECORDED as the last
    searched term or the poll re-fires every frame forever.
  - ⚠️ `SRCHDET` lines are escaped into STML (`<` `>` `&`) before display — an item name containing
    `<` would otherwise swallow the rest of the panel.
  - Install: `aotv4_client_install/ALLACLONE_WINDOW_INSTALL.md`.
- 📌 **TODO — the Portal window is still a GDI overlay** and should get the same treatment for the
  same reasons: self-drawn chrome never matches EQ, it can't scale with the UI, and it only works
  windowed. Client-side-only change; its wire format can stay.
- ⚠️ **A `<Button>` uses `<Template>BDT_Normal</Template>`, NOT `<ButtonDrawTemplate>`.** The tag
  name differs from the inline form used for icon buttons, and only the ~34 `BDT_*` names actually
  defined in `EQUI_Templates.xml` resolve — anything else draws an empty hole with no error, the
  same failure mode as a mis-cased texture name.
- **Client install:** copy `EQUI_AoTSpellChoiceWnd.xml` to `uifiles/default/` **and**
  `<Include>EQUI_AoTSpellChoiceWnd.xml</Include>` in `EQUI.xml`. Missing either = `CCustomWnd` can't
  find its screen and returns **silently** — no error, no window.

> **Loader-lock:** the `Enable*` functions run inside `DllMain` (DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH). Only
> **memory-patch detours** (`EzDetour`) are safe there. Window/D3D/thread creation must be
> deferred to runtime (first chat line / first `ProcessGameEvents`), or startup hard-fails
> (`0xc0000142`).

## 4. Combat skills & cross-class abilities

Goal: a Bard inherits **other classes' skills/abilities**. Three layers had to agree.

**(a) Reward-gating (Lua).** `skill_pool.lua` is the rotation pool — **only class-specific
activated abilities** (Backstab, Bash, Kick, Disarm, Taunt, Berserking, Frenzy, and the monk
strikes Dragon Punch/Eagle Strike/Flying/Round Kick/Tiger Claw). Passive skills (weapon skills,
Offense/Defense, Dodge/Parry/Riposte/Block, Double/Triple Attack, Dual Wield, Intimidation) are
**auto-learned** via `global_player.lua` `free_skills` and never rotate. A picked skill is set
to `SKILL_GRANT_PCT` of its cap.

**(b) Client unlock hook (`core_spellwindow.cpp`, `areSkillsUnlocked`).** The RoF2 client hides
skills a class isn't coded for. We detour `CSkillMgr::GetSkillCap` (`0x5BAEC0`,
args `pChar, level, class, skill, …`) and **only reveal hidden skills** — a native skill
(cap > 0) passes through untouched (so weapon skills are never removed); real skill ids `0..76`
that the class can't natively have get a level-scaled cap (unused slots `77+` stay 0, no "None"
rows). Reward-gated *combat* skills are revealed **only if earned** — the server sends
`SKILLUNLOCKDATA <csv of earned skill ids>` (skills with value > 0) on connect and after each
pick; the hook hides un-earned combat skills from both the Skills window and the ability picker.

**(c) Server execution (`/src/zone/special_attacks.cpp`, `Client::OPCombatAbility`).** EQEmu
class-gates the activated specials. Patched to be **skill-gated** (any class that trained the
skill): Kick (added `GetSkill(SkillKick) > 0` to `can_use_kick`), the monk strikes (dispatch if
`is_monk_special`, not just `class == Monk`), Backstab (`|| GetSkill(SkillBackstab) > 0`).
Disarm/Taunt/Frenzy were already skill-gated; Bash needs a shield. `MonkSpecialAttack` has no
internal class checks (damage = `GetBaseSkillDamage`), so it's safe cross-class. **Requires a
zone rebuild** (§8).

## 5. Spell pool & blacklist (era / junk filtering)

> **2026-07-26: the pool is back to the STOCK spell set.** The 113-spell custom set (43000-43149)
> briefly replaced it and proved mostly redundant with native spells. Regenerate with
> **`perl .devcontainer/custom/spells/gen_stock_pool.pl`**, which writes all three generated modules
> (`spell_pool.lua` 2605 spells over 78 levels, `spell_icons.lua`, `spell_desc.lua`) from
> `id < 10000` + the **20 unique customs** that are kept — the Lua-driven abilities (every effect
> slot 254; behaviour lives in `quests/global/spells/43xxx.lua`, `aotv4_summon_table`,
> `aotv4_reactions`). The other 93 customs stay in the DB but are **never offered**; full restore of
> all 202 rows is `custom/sql/aotv4_custom_spells_backup.sql`, and the superseded generated modules
> are in `custom/spells/old_custom_pool/`. **Rerun `aotv4_client_install/gen_choice_xml.pl` after
> any pool regen** so the picker's icon set matches (§3). Zone restart to reload the Lua modules.
> ⚠️ `%` in a description is spelled out by the generator: `Client::Message` is printf-style, so a
> stray `%` is eaten as a format token.
>
> **Adding new custom spells to the pool: use band `43300-43349`** (helpers/triggers at **43350+**,
> which are never offered). The generator pulls that band wholesale, so unlike the 43000-43149
> customs they may use effect slots. Two lines exist so far, both filling the empty low half of a
> native SPA 323 "add defensive proc" line and both cloned **via a temp table** so all ~236 columns
> stay byte-identical to stock (never hand-list the columns):
>   - `custom/sql/aotv4_reptile_line.sql` — Druid *Skin of the Reptile* (stock 8008/8009, level 68),
>     heal-on-being-hit. Six tiers **8/18/28/38/48/58** = ids **43300-43305** / triggers 43350-43355.
>   - `custom/sql/aotv4_sloth_line.sql` — Shaman *Lingering Sloth* (stock 8015/8016, level 68, the
>     line's **only** stock member), retaliation-slow. Ids **43306-43311** / triggers 43356-43361.
>   - `custom/sql/aotv4_moonfire_line.sql` — a **lifetap weighted 25% damage / 75% heal**, ids
>     **43312-43317**. Damage ≈ half the native lifetap for the level, healing 3× the damage.
>     ⚠️⚠️ **The 3× split cannot be expressed in the DB.** EQEmu hardcodes the tap ratio —
>     `int64 healed = damage;` (`zone/attack.cpp:4287`) — and `spells_new` has no ratio column. So
>     the rows are **real taps** (`targettype 13` ST_Tap, what `IsLifetapSpell` keys on,
>     `common/spdat.cpp:108`) and the engine pays the first 1×, while
>     `quests/global/spells/433xx.lua` + `lua_modules/aotv4_moonfire.lua` add the remaining 2×.
>     **Change a damage value in the SQL and you MUST change that tier script's bonus (= 2× damage).**
>     Staying a genuine tap matters beyond the heal: `IsLifetapSpell` excludes it from
>     `IsDamageSpell`/`IsAnyDamageSpell`/`IsDamageOverTimeSpell` and drives the tap emote.
>     ⚠️ No tier is named "Moonfire": stock **2877 Moonfire** (Druid 60 nuke) is already in the pool
>     and would be a real duplicate.
>   - `custom/sql/aotv4_promised_line.sql` — **delayed "bloom" heals**, ids **43324-43329** / blooms
>     43368-43373. Cast it, wait 3 ticks, it heals when the buff expires naturally. Uses the native
>     **SPA 289 `CastOnFadeEffect`** (`common/spdat.h:1352`) — no Lua needed, unlike 43017 Languid
>     Healing which predates knowing about it. Cloned from stock 9755/9758 (*Promised Renewal*).
>     ⚠️ The native Promised family is effectively **unreachable**: it starts at level **73** and
>     every tier above 9755 is **id ≥ 10000**, which the pool's `id < 10000` filter excludes.
>     ⚠️ Keep the **SPA 44 + SPA 148 pair**: slot 2 (SPA 44) carries the heal amount as a *stacking
>     marker* and slot 3 (`StackingCommand_Block`, base 44) reads it, which is how Promised heals
>     refuse to overwrite a stronger one. Slot 2's base must equal the real heal or the tiers stack.

> ⚠️⚠️ **THE BARD PIVOT SILENTLY BROKE ALL-CLASS SPELL ACCESS (fixed 2026-07-27).** While every
character was forced to Bard, "any class can use anything" was free -- the pool only had to be legal
for Bard. Opening the server to 16 classes removed that and the STOCK set was never reopened: of
2,707 pool spells, **ZERO** were castable by all classes, and **bard songs carry a real level only
in `classes8`** so 15 of 16 classes could be offered a song and then simply never use it. Three gates
all had to be reopened, and any one left shut makes the reward useless:
1. `spells_new.classes1..16` -- can the class scribe/cast it
2. `skill_caps` **Singing 12, Percussion 41, Stringed 49, Wind 54, Brass 70** -- only Bard had ANY
3. `skill_caps` for the twelve activated combat specials -- without a cap `CanHaveSkill` refuses and
   a picked reward silently does nothing
All three are in `custom/sql/aotv4_open_spells_and_skills.sql`. ⚠️ Running step 3 DESTROYS the record
of which classes had a special natively -- the only surviving copy is `skill_pool.NATIVE`.

⚠️ **The generator writes `spell_blacklist.lua` too — it MUST be regenerated with the pool.** When

`spell_pool.lua` is generated from `spells_new`, indexed by learn level. The reward is
**expansion-capped by level**: a char is only offered spells at/below its level, and a spell's
learn level sits in its expansion's band (classic 1-50, Kunark/Velious/Luclin 51-60, PoP+ 61-70…).
Filter: `id < 10000` (drops ~30k modern rank/revamp spells), no `Rk.` versions, learnable
(`classes8` = lowest class level; we set `classes8 = LEAST(real class cols)` for Bard usability,
so it doubles as the index). Regenerate:
```bash
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -upeq -ppeqpass peq -N -e "
  SELECT classes8,id,name FROM spells_new
  WHERE id<10000 AND name NOT LIKE '% Rk. %' AND classes8 BETWEEN 1 AND 100
  ORDER BY classes8,id;"   # then format to  [lvl]={ {id=,name=}, ... }  (see git history)
```

`spell_blacklist.lua` (**generated**) = `{ [id]=true }` of spells **never** offered, applied at
runtime in `spell_choice.gather_candidates`. Criteria:
- resurrect (effect `81`), Enchant-material (name `Enchant %`),
- curse-counter cures (effect `116` with **negative** base = removes curse counters),
- LDoN dungeon-object utility (`targettype = 34` — Iony's/Reebo's appraise/disarm/unlock lines).

> No expansion column exists in `spells_new`, and Allakhazam/EQ-Resource are JS-rendered (can't
> crawl). So era filtering is the `id<10000` + level approximation, not a surgical classic list.

## 6. Death-driven AA rewards (roguelite) — ⚠️ RETIRED 2026-07-25, kept as history

> **Random AA is gone and AA is back to BASE EQ**: earned as AA experience, spent in the client's own
> AA window. The whole picker is unwired — `global_player.lua` no longer requires `aa_choice` (no
> `grant_picks` on death, no `handle_say`, no `reoffer_if_banked`), the dll's AA overlay is **deleted**
> (§3), and `aa_choice.lua`/`aa_pool.lua` remain on disk but nothing loads them. The dll still swallows
> stray `AACHOICEDATA`/`AADESCDATA` lines so they can never reach chat.
> **DB revert = `custom/sql/aotv4_aa_revert.sql`** (restores `aa_ranks.level_req`, `aa_ability.classes`
> and `grant_only` from `utils/sql/peq_aa_tables_post_rework.sql`, because `aotv4_aa.sql` overwrote the
> originals in place). Until it runs, `grant_only=1` hides all 382 tagged AAs from the native window.
> ⚠️ Retiring this **orphans `era_system.check_unlock`** — see §12.


A second progression layer parallel to the level-up window. **On death, ALL of the run's
experience is banked as Alternate Advancement and the character is reset to level 1** — AAs are
the permanent meta-progression; levels are per-run. A second random picker (its own chat channel,
so it can drive a separate dll window) then spends the banked points.

### Server side (Lua)
- `global_player.lua` `event_death(e)`: `SetLevel(1)`, `SetEXP(0, GetAAExp())`, then bank
  `floor(total_xp / divisor)` points by calling `aa_choice.grant_picks(e, banked)`. **The points go
  into a PRIVATE data bucket (`aa_bank_<charid>`), NOT the native unspent pool** — so the native AA
  (V) window shows 0 spendable points and the player can't bypass the picker to buy AAs directly.
  Picks are granted **free** (`ignore_cost=true`) and the cost is deducted from the bucket.
  **Diminishing returns:** `divisor = AA_XP_BASE * (1 + GetSpentAA()*AA_SCALE)` — the more AAs you
  own, the more XP each new point costs (`AA_XP_BASE=15M` ≈ 10 points at a level-50 death;
  `AA_SCALE=0.005`). `event_say` calls `aa_choice.handle_say(e)` (alongside `spell_choice`).
- `aa_choice.lua` — **budget-driven** picker. The player's *unspent* pool (`GetAAPoints`) IS the
  budget. Each pop offers `CHOICE_COUNT` (3) random AAs that are **affordable** (`cost ≤ budget`)
  **and prereq-satisfied**, emits `AACHOICEDATA <banked>^name|icon|cost|cls^…` + a sibling
  `AADESCDATA d1^d2^d3` line (drives the dll window) **plus** chat saylinks (work with no client
  mod). Picking trains the next rank **free** (`GrantAlternateAdvancementAbility(id, cur+1, true)`)
  and deducts the cost from the private bank; it keeps popping until nothing is affordable
  (`MAX_PICKS=30` cap). Tunables at top. Buckets: `aa_bank_/aa_choice_/aa_seed_/aa_pcount_<charid>`.
  Seed RNG on a per-offer counter (post-death `GetEXP`/level are 0).
  **Per-AA cap (`RANK_BUDGET=10`):** an AA is only offered while its *total* investment
  (`next_rank * cost`) stays within the cap, so no single AA needs more than ~one death's bank —
  cheap AAs (cost 2) still reach ~rank 5 (enough for rank≤3 prereqs), a cost-9 AA stays rank 1.
  Keep `RANK_BUDGET` in step with the per-death bank (`AA_XP_BASE`); raise BOTH as the level cap rises.
- **dll window** (`core_spellwindow.cpp`, `areAAChoiceWindowEnabled`): a SECOND layered GDI window
  (cool slate theme, lower-third placement) parallel to the spell window. It **shares the same two
  detours** (`dsp_chat`, `ProcessGameEvents`) — both can't re-hook the same address, so the AA code
  lives in those bodies, gated by feature flags. Shows **banked AA in the header**, each choice's
  **cost**, a Train button → `/say aapick N` (echo swallowed like `spellpick`), and a **bottom
  description panel** that shows the hovered row's text. Both windows have the hover/desc panel
  (`DrawDescPanel` + `RowAtY`, fed by `SPELLDESCDATA`/`AADESCDATA`).
- `aa_pool.lua` (**generated**) — `pool[level]={ {id=,name=,icon=,cls=,cost=,desc=,pr={{a=,r=}}}, … }`.
  `icon` = cast-spell `new_icon`, else a thematic fallback by name (heal/caster/melee/defense/song/
  craft). `cost` = first-rank cost, `desc` = `db_str` type 4 (truncated), `pr` = first-rank prereqs.
  Generated from the **Bard-tagged** (`classes&128`) set — which the migration restricts to **classic
  (expansion ≤4), level ≤60, real-named, deduped-by-name** AAs (so no "Unknown DB String"/modern
  clutter). `spell_desc.lua` (gen, `db_str` type 6) feeds the spell window's hover the same way.
  The picker's `prereqs_met` mirrors the server's prereq loop so it never offers a rejectable AA.
- **Hiding untrained from the native window:** the tagged set is also flagged `grant_only=1`. The
  native AA window then lists each only once **trained** and can't buy it there (the picker grants
  via `ignore_cost=true` → `CanPurchase` `check_grant=false`, so `grant_only` doesn't block us).

### Three things had to agree (like combat skills)
1. **Class-agnostic.** Migration `aa_ability.classes |= 128` adds the Bard bit. The AA loader does
   `a->classes = e.classes << 1` (zone/aa.cpp:1792), so the DB's `1<<(class-1)` (Bard=128) becomes
   `1<<class` (256) in memory — which is exactly what the **stock** gate `classes & (1<<GetClass())`
   checks. ⚠️ **Do NOT "fix" that line to `GetPlayerClassBit`** — the `<<1` makes it correct;
   "fixing" it breaks every narrow-class AA. `aa.cpp` stays **stock**.
2. **Expansion.** AAs start in Luclin (`aa_ranks.expansion ≥ 3`). With classic theming
   (`Expansion:CurrentExpansion=0`), the rule **`Expansion:UseCurrentExpansionAAOnly` blocks ALL
   AAs** — set it **`false`**; expansion gating is done by the pool instead (like spells). The
   per-char `m_pp.expansions` check still applies (it = `RuleI(World, ExpansionSettings)` = all).
3. **Level gate.** Migration lowers `aa_ranks.level_req` `1..60 → 1` (deps preserved) so normal
   ranks are buyable at the always-level-1 post-death state. Ranks with original `level_req > 60`
   stay gated (unreachable while picking at level 1 — acceptable; they're raid-tier).

### Reset AAs for testing (char must be at **character select**)
```sql
SET @cid:=(SELECT id FROM character_data WHERE name='Ashrem');
DELETE FROM character_alternate_abilities WHERE id=@cid;
UPDATE character_data SET aa_points=0, aa_points_spent=0, aa_exp=0 WHERE id=@cid;
```
GM `#resetaa aa` only *refunds* spent → unspent (doesn't zero the pool). The migration +
`UseCurrentExpansionAAOnly` live in `.devcontainer/custom/sql/aotv4_aa.sql`.

## 7. Database setup
- **All 16 classes are playable** (§14). Historically every char was forced to Bard (`class = 8`); the
  force is removed and `char_create_combinations` restored to all classes. Existing chars stay Bard.
- **`spells_new.classes8`** = the spell's min learnable level (= the reward-pool index). It's now also
  opened across every class column (`classes1..16`) so all classes can scribe/cast the reward spells.
- ⚠️ **Combat specials: NATIVE ones are auto-granted, the rest are picker rewards.** Every class now
  has a `skill_caps` entry for all twelve (it must, or a picked reward cannot be granted), so
  `CanHaveSkill` is no longer a useful filter and the DB can no longer say what was native.
  `skill_pool.NATIVE` is the only record. `global_player.grant_native_combat_skills` grants a class
  its own on connect AND on level up (some cap curves only open above level 1);
  `spell_choice.gather_skill_candidates` offers only `skill_pool.rotatable_for(class)`.
- ⚠️ **`skill_pool.lua` is now a MODULE, not a bare table.** It exposes `.SKILLS`, `.NATIVE`,
  `.is_native()` and `.rotatable_for()`. `pairs(skills)` no longer yields skill ids -- use
  `pairs(skills.SKILLS)`. A `__index` metatable keeps `skills[id]` working for existing callers, but
  `pairs` does NOT follow it.
- **Bard `skill_caps`** (`class_id=8`) raised so skills scale; client also needs the exported
  `SkillCaps.txt` (`export_client_files`) installed in the EQ root.
- **Expansion lock:** `rule_values Expansion:CurrentExpansion = 0` (Classic).
- Test char `Ashrem`: Bard, GM. (Reset a char's combat skills via
  `UPDATE character_skills SET value=0 WHERE id=<charid> AND skill_id IN (...)` — only sticks
  while that char is at **character select**, else the live zone saves over it.)

## 8. Building

**`dinput8.dll`** (Windows, Visual Studio): project
`eq-core-dll/src/eq-core-dll-vs2022.vcxproj` (toolset **v143**). Non-default settings for the
legacy MQ2-derived code: `ConformanceMode=false`, `LanguageStandard=stdcpp14`, `SDLCheck=false`,
defines `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS;_WINSOCK_DEPRECATED_NO_WARNINGS`. `core_spellwindow.cpp` links
`gdi32`/`user32` via `#pragma comment`. **Close EQ before copying** (it locks the dll).

**Server (zone, etc.)** in the dev container — ninja:
```bash
cd /src/build && ninja zone     # ~minutes; relinks bin/zone
```
After a server-code change you MUST restart **every** booted zone (see §10), not just the pool.

## 9. Porting elsewhere

**To a player's CLIENT:** copy `dinput8.dll` next to `eqgame.exe`; run **windowed**; stock
`uifiles/default/spellsNN.tga` provide icons. Install the exported `SkillCaps.txt` (+ optionally
`spells_us.txt`, `dbstr_us.txt`) in the EQ root so skill caps/levels match the server. The dll's
offsets (`0x51F1A0`, `0x539E60`, `0x51FCE0`, `0x5BAEC0`) are for this exact RoF2 build — a
different build needs them re-derived. (`EQUI_SpellChoiceWnd.xml` is dead — overlay is self-drawn.)

**To another SERVER:** copy the `quests/lua_modules/*` + the `global_player.lua` hooks;
regenerate `spell_pool.lua`/`spell_icons.lua`/`spell_blacklist.lua` **and** `aa_pool.lua` from
that DB; apply the `special_attacks.cpp` patches and rebuild zone; run `custom/sql/aotv4_aa.sql`
(AA class/level migration) and set `Expansion:UseCurrentExpansionAAOnly=false`; set the DB (Bard
class, `classes8`, skill caps, expansion). The windows are generic (`SPELLCHOICEDATA name|icon` /
`spellpick N`; `AACHOICEDATA name|icon|cost` / `aapick N`). `aa.cpp` stays stock.

## 10. Gotchas / lessons learned
- **Lua + server-code reloads:** `#reloadquest` does NOT reload `require`d Lua modules, and a
  rebuilt `zone` binary only takes effect in **freshly-booted** zones. After a Lua or C++ change,
  kill **all** zone procs (`for p in $(pgrep -x zone); do kill -9 $p; done`) so `eqlaunch`
  respawns them — killing only `dynamic_*` leaves already-booted named zones (e.g. freporte) on
  the old code. Then **relog**.
- **Can't hook EQ's D3D device** — dummy-device vtable trick fails here; use the layered window.
- **DllMain loader lock** — defer window/thread/D3D creation out of the `Enable*` functions.
- **Skill cap hook** — only *reveal* (cap 0 → value); never override a native cap, and bound to
  ids `0..76` or you get "None" rows. Skill values live in `CHARINFO2` (not the `pChar`
  `CHARINFO` passed to `GetSkillCap`) — that's why earned-state comes via server sync, not memory.
- **Activated abilities = 3 layers** — client display (`GetSkillCap`), client *send*
  (only for skills it thinks you have), and server *execute* (`special_attacks.cpp` class gates).
  All three must allow it.
- **Spell icon mapping** — raw index (`icon/36`, `icon%36`), 0 = none; derive columns from sheet
  width, don't assume 6.
- **Bazaar** — RoF2 only ships the revamped (DoN) bazaar; the old Luclin bazaar is unobtainable
  on a vanilla client.
- **AA class bitmask is shifted** — `aa_ability.classes` is loaded as `classes << 1`
  (zone/aa.cpp), so the gate `classes & (1<<GetClass())` is correct *as-is*. Tag Bard with the DB
  bit **128** (`classes | 128`), NOT 256, and **don't** rewrite the gate to `GetPlayerClassBit`.
  Symptom of getting it wrong: 65535 (all-class) AAs grant but narrow-class AAs silently fail.
- **AAs aren't in shared memory** — the zone loads `aa_ability`/`aa_ranks` straight from the DB at
  boot, so DB edits just need a zone restart (no `./shared_memory` rebuild). Rules are also read at
  boot — a `rule_values` change (e.g. `UseCurrentExpansionAAOnly`) needs a restart, not a reload.
- ⚠️⚠️ **A custom AA must REUSE a native row — a new id never reaches the client.** The server
  resolves it, passes every check in `CanUseAlternateAdvancementRank` and sends the packet (proven
  with logging); the client silently discards it. Ability ids above the native max **30195** and
  rank ids above **65535** both fail this way, no error anywhere. Take over an existing ability
  instead: keep its id, rank ids, `title_sid` and rank chain, replace only `aa_rank_effects` and the
  `db_str` strings (`custom/sql/aotv4_aa_tank_hosted.sql`).
- ⚠️⚠️ **`aa_rank_prereqs` IS A SEPARATE TABLE AND MUST BE CLEARED TOO.** A hosted AA inherits its
  host's prerequisites, so it appears in the window but **refuses to train with no message**.
  Clearing `aa_rank_effects` does nothing to it. Eight AAs were untrainable this way.
- ⚠️ **Walk the rank chain via `next_id` — rank ids are NOT contiguous.** Natural Durability's chain
  is **107 → 108 → 109 → 7541 → 7542 → 7543**; assuming `first_rank_id + 0..4` wrote costs and levels
  onto ranks 110/111, which belong to a different ability. Terminate a chain early with
  `next_id = -1` to control how many ranks show (otherwise the window reads e.g. "0/15").
- ⚠️⚠️ **There is NO usable native "survive a killing blow" effect.** All three death hooks were
  checked (2026-07-26, Borrowed Breath) and every one fails for a different reason:
  - **SPA 232 `DivineSave`** (`TryDivineSave`) is the only one that runs inside the `HasDied()`
    branch, but it unconditionally casts **4789 Touch of the Divine** — SPA 40 Divine Aura for up to
    **36 s**. Under it you cannot attack (`attack.cpp:1743`), cannot cast (`spells.cpp:566`), and
    **no other caster can land any spell on you, heals included** (`spells.cpp:4147` — *"invuln mobs
    can't be affected by any spells, good or bad"*). You are also unattackable, so the boss drops
    the tank and turns on the healer. It keeps you alive by removing you from the fight. This is
    also exactly what the **"Second Chance" tribute** is (worn effect 5612/5613/5614 *Divine Res*).
  - **SPA 150 `DeathSave`** (Divine Intervention / Death Pact) is **not a death save here** —
    `TryDeathSave` is called from the *else* branch, only on crossing below 16 % health **alive**.
    Its chance also comes off the *saved player's* Charisma, which is backwards for a role AA.
  - **`SpellOnDeath`** (`TrySpellOnDeath`) always returns false on purpose; the comment
    (`mob.cpp:6636`) says a heal placed there cannot register before death kills you.
  - ⚠️ **Tributes are not a separate mechanism.** `CalcBonuses` resolves a tribute to an ITEM and
    runs it through `AddItemBonuses(..., is_tribute=true)` (`bonuses.cpp:177`), so a tribute can
    only ever deliver the same SPAs.
  - The working answer is a hand-rolled check in `Mob::Damage`'s `HasDied()` branch before the
    native saves — `Mob::AoTv4TryBorrowedBreath` (`zone/aotv4_healer_aa.cpp`). Return at a share of
    max HP, not 1 HP: at 1 HP the next tick of anything undoes the save.
- **The AA window tab is `aa_ability.type`**, not `category` (category is a sub-grouping header
  *within* a tab). 1 General / 2 Archetype / 3 Class / 4 Special, relabelled **Tank / Healer /
  Ranged / Melee** in `aotv4_client_install/uifiles_default/EQUI_AAWindow.xml` (a stock file we
  overwrite; no `<Include>` needed). Labels are XML-driven — the stock strings aren't in
  `eqgame.exe` — but page/listbox `item=` names resolve positionally, so rename only `<TabText>`.
- **AA names come from `db_str`** (type 1 title, type 4 description) resolved by the CLIENT out of
  its own `dbstr_us.txt`, so a `db_str` change needs `./export_client_files` + reinstalling that
  file. `title_sid = -1` renders **no row at all** — it does not fall back to `aa_ability.name`.
- ⚠️⚠️ **`title_sid` and `desc_sid` are INDEPENDENT, and neither is guaranteed to equal
  `first_rank_id`.** 22 of our 23 hosts have `title_sid = desc_sid = first_rank_id`, which makes it
  look like a rule — **Quick Damage (44) does not**: `title_sid 141`, `desc_sid` **12863**. Writing
  the description to the title sid gave an AA with the right NAME and the host's ORIGINAL
  description, with no error anywhere. Always
  `SELECT title_sid, desc_sid FROM aa_ranks WHERE id = <first_rank_id>` before writing `db_str` for
  a new host, or repoint `desc_sid` to match the title sid as `aotv4_aa_ranged.sql` now does.
- **`items` (and `spells_new`) ARE in shared memory** — unlike AAs, item edits need a full rebuild:
  stop world+zones, `cd build/bin && ./shared_memory`, restart world (zones reboot on demand). Do it
  with world DOWN, or world keeps the stale mmap.
- **Gear tiers** (`custom/sql/aotv4_gear_tiers.sql`): two tiers above native, generated from
  obtainable equippable gear (slots>0, in lootdrop_entries/merchantlist, **base ids <300,000** —
  never re-tier our own rows). **Hallowed = base id +300,000** (stats/resists/dmg ×2, hp/mana/end
  ×2, AC ×1.5, int→.5 spelldmg, wis→.5 healamt, str/agi/dex /10 → attack/strikethrough/accuracy,
  instruments ×1.5, tradeable). **Mythic = +600,000** (hp/mana/end ×2.5, AC ×2, int/wis→1×
  spelldmg/healamt, +½ heroic on every stat+resist, instruments ×2, **No Drop**). All three tiers:
  classes/races=65535, not-lore; **native + Hallowed tradeable, only Mythic No Drop**. Derived stats
  use the scaled (×2) values.
  - ⚠️ **Tier rows ALREADY inherit `price`/`sellrate` from the native — do not "fix" this** (checked
    2026-07-28: 0 of 54,292 tier rows differ from their base on either column). The clone is
    `INSERT … SELECT *` and nothing in the script touches those columns. 33,720 tier rows show a
    price of 0 only because **the base item's price is 0 too**; there is nothing to inherit.
  - ⚠️⚠️ **"Mythic won't sell" is NO DROP, not price.** `Handle_OP_ShopPlayerSell` bails at
    `if (!item->NoDrop) return;` (`client_packet.cpp:15221`) *before* price is read, and
    `Client::AdvLootSellValue` returns 0 for the same reason (`:10674`). A Mythic carries the native's
    full price and still cannot be sold to a vendor — that is the design, not a bug. The 17 Hallowed
    rows that also refuse are the **epics**, forced Lore + No Drop at the end of the tier script.
  Two C++ hooks (tracked patches): `NPC::AddLootDropTable` (loot.cpp) rolls **25% Hallowed / 5%
  Mythic** per base drop (mode-independent, since `lootdrop_entries.chance` is a weight in the
  dominant weighted loot mode); `AoTv4MythicReward` (questmgr.cpp + lua_client.cpp) upgrades
  **quest-reward** gear to its Mythic tier (epics never hand out native). Re-run the SQL → rebuild
  shared memory → restart.
  - ⚠️ **Tier offset = 300,000 (step), NOT 1,000,000.** RoF2 item LINKS encode the id in a
    5-hex-digit field masked to `0xFFFFF` (1,048,575, see `common/say_link.cpp`), so an item id
    ≥ 1,048,576 makes its chat link render as garbage (and can desync the client link parser for
    following lines). The old +1M/+2M scheme broke every Mythic link (and Hallowed of base >48,575).
    Base ids top out at 147,494, so the step is **300,000**: Hallowed = base+1×step, Mythic =
    base+2×step, band `[300000,900000)`, all under the ceiling; base recovery is `id % 300000`.
    The step lives in **5 C++ spots** (loot.cpp, npc.cpp, questmgr.cpp, attack.cpp, and
    tradeskills.cpp `AOTV4_TIER_STEP`) — keep them in step with the SQL. Renumbering existing tier
    ids is a one-time `custom/sql/aotv4_tier_renumber.sql` (migrates live inventory/merchant/etc.
    refs; spares the refine bag 2000060).
- **Never run `make zone`** — that Makefile target is NOT a build; it runs a **bare `./zone`** (no
  instance args), which registers with world as an unmanaged static zone ("Zone started with name
  [.] by launcher [NONE]") and **breaks zone routing** (clients time out on enter-world). To rebuild
  the zone binary use `cd /src/build && ninja zone`. If clients can't zone in, check for rogue bare
  `./zone` procs and **exactly one** `eqlaunch` (`pgrep -x eqlaunch`); kill extras + restart world.
- **`small` is a Windows macro** — `<rpcndr.h>` does `#define small char`, so a local named
  `small` (e.g. `HFONT small`) miscompiles into `HFONT char` with a cascade of bogus errors. Avoid
  `small`/`hyper` as identifiers in the dll.
- **AA grant rejected silently** — `GrantAlternateAdvancementAbility(...false)` returns false (no
  message) if any of: class bit, `rank->expansion` vs `UseCurrentExpansionAAOnly`, `level_req`,
  cost > unspent, or unmet `aa_rank_prereqs`. The picker pre-filters on affordability + prereqs so
  only grantable AAs are ever offered.
- **Orphaned zones = "characters time out on login."** If you restart `eqlaunch` while old `zone`
  procs are still alive, those zones become orphans still registered with world; world routes clients
  to a dead zone → login timeout. Tell-tale: many `zone` procs with **pids lower than the current
  `eqlaunch`**. Fix: kill ALL `zone` + `eqlaunch` + `world`, then restart world → eqlaunch (exactly
  one eqlaunch). Prefer **not** restarting eqlaunch at all — kill zones and let the current eqlaunch
  respawn them.
- **Detach long-running procs or a shell timeout kills them.** Start world/eqlaunch with
  `setsid nohup ./world > log 2>&1 < /dev/null &` — a plain `nohup … &` still dies when the foreground
  shell that launched it times out (SIGTERM hits the whole process group).
- **Bazaar seller double-pay** — the native `ServerOP_BazaarPurchase` flow **already pays the seller**
  (`trader_pc->AddMoneyToPP` in the seller's zone). Do NOT also pay in `BuyTraderItemOutsideBazaar`;
  the single authoritative payout is the **world** handler (online → route to seller's zone; offline →
  escrow bucket). See §13.
- **Trader item serials aren't stable across relog** (`GetNextItemInstSerialNumber` is a runtime
  counter). Anything that must survive a relog (e.g. the shop's `item_sn` handle) needs a persistent
  key — the player shop uses a `shopsn_<charid>` counter bucket, not the item serial.

## 11. Discovered-PoK-book travel network

A personal fast-travel system over the Plane of Knowledge books.
- **Discover** — `global_player.lua` `event_click_door`: clicking any door whose destination is
  `poknowledge` calls `pok_travel.discover(zone)` AND **`return 1`** (cancels the door's `HandleClick`
  so the book does NOT teleport you to PoK — `Handle_OP_ClickDoor` skips `HandleClick` when the event
  returns non-zero). Books are pure discovery markers.
- **Ungated** — the PoK books are PoP-era (`doors.min_expansion 4/7/9`), so on a Classic server
  (`CurrentExpansion=0`) they'd be content-filtered out. `custom/sql/aotv4_pok_travel.sql` sets
  `min_expansion=max_expansion=-1` on all `dest_zone='poknowledge'` doors so they always spawn.
  Doors load from the DB at zone boot (NOT shared memory) → restart zones after.
- **Lua** — `pok_travel.lua` + `pok_portals.lua` (gen: short→{id,x,y,z,h,long} for the 33 book-zones).
  Discovered set in bucket `pok_found_<charid>`. Chat protocol: `PORTALDATA short|Long^…` out; `/say
  portalgo <short>` travels (`MovePC`); `/say portalreq` = silent list refresh (dll); `/say portals` =
  list + saylinks (no-mod fallback).
  - ⚠️ **Landing-coord rule (regeneration):** landing = the PoK-side **return** door's dest **when one
    exists** (game-tuned, lands ~by the book). **14 of the 33 zones have NO PoK→zone return book**
    (bazaar, feerrott2, freeportwest, freportw, innothule, innothuleb, mistythicket, shadowrest,
    steamfont, steamfontmts, tox, toxxulia, weddingchapel, weddingchapeldark) — for those the landing
    MUST be the zone's **own book position** (`doors.pos_x/y/z` where `dest_zone='poknowledge'`), NOT
    the zone **safe point**. The generator originally used the safe point → those 14 dropped you at
    map-center; they're hand-corrected in `pok_portals.lua` (each tagged `-- book … (no return door)`).
- **Opening** — clicking a PoK book opens the window: `event_click_door` calls `pok_travel.open`
  which sends **`PORTALOPEN`**; the dll's chat detour sets `g_portalVisible=true`. (So you open the
  menu *at a book* — no hotkey.) `pok_travel.discover` still fires on the same click (attune if new).
- **dll window** (`core_spellwindow.cpp`, `arePortalWindowEnabled`): a 3rd layered window (teal).
  Scrollable list (mouse-wheel + title-bar **Up/Dn** page buttons, `PORTAL_VIS=9`) of discovered
  zones; a row's **Travel** button queues `g_portalPendingShort` → `/say portalgo <short>` on the
  game thread. **Closes** on: right-click, Travel, EQ losing foreground, a **20s idle timeout**
  (`PORTAL_TIMEOUT_MS`, reset on any interaction → covers walking away), or `PORTALCLOSE` which
  `event_enter_zone` sends on any zone change. Swallows `PORTALDATA`/`PORTALOPEN`/`PORTALCLOSE` +
  `portalgo`/`portalreq` echoes.

## 12. Expansion-unlock-on-AA-maxout (era progression) — ⚠️ trigger orphaned 2026-07-25

> `era_system.check_unlock` had exactly ONE caller: `aa_choice.handle_say` (after a successful AA pick).
> Random AA is retired (§6), so **nothing advances `aotv4_era` any more** — the server is frozen at
> whatever era the bucket holds (Classic unless it was already advanced). Everything else in the module
> still works and is still called: `clamp_level` (level cap, from `event_level_up`) and `sync_zone`.
> A replacement unlock condition needs designing — achievements (§15) are the obvious candidate, since
> the AA-maxout test is meaningless once AA is base EQ.


A server-wide progression race: the **first character to MAX every AA in the current era's tier
unlocks the next expansion for EVERYONE** (Classic → Omens of War). Plan/ceilings/cadence live in
`AOTV4_EXPANSION_PLAN.md`. Source of truth = the **GLOBAL** data bucket `aotv4_era` (0..8); every
zone reads it, so gating is consistent and survives restarts.

- **`era_system.lua`** — the era table (`name/expansion/cap/cap_exp` per era 0-8), `current()`,
  `level_cap()`, `check_unlock(client)` (maxout test + advance + `eq.world_emote` broadcast +
  `eq.set_rule` content bump), `clamp_level(client)`, `sync_zone()`.
- **Maxout test** = *every AA with `era <= current` is at its max picker rank* (`aa.mr` in the
  pool). This is authoritative — robust to the picker's floored-cost accounting and escalating
  native rank costs (so `GetSpentAA()` is NOT used as the threshold).
- **`aa_pool.lua`** is now **era-tiered**: 353 AAs (Classic..OoW), all at `pool[1]`, each with
  `era` (0-8 unlock tier) + `mr` (max picker rank). Regenerated from the DB; greedy-filled by
  native expansion to the plan's cumulative ceilings. `aa_choice.gather_affordable` offers only
  `aa.era <= era_system.current()`.
- **Level cap** is enforced LIVE in `global_player.event_level_up` via `era_system.clamp_level`
  (Lua, no rule restart): holds the character at the era cap and pins exp at `cap_exp` so a death
  banks the tuned amount (not an ever-growing pile from grinding at cap). The cap also gates the
  **spell** pool for free (the spell picker only offers <= player level).
- **Detection** is in `aa_choice.handle_say` after a successful pick → `era_system.check_unlock`.
  The first char to max the current tier advances `aotv4_era`; others already past that bar don't
  re-trigger (next ceiling is higher). A single char can cascade tiers across picks (still gated by
  their own death-spending).
- **Live vs restart**: level/spell/AA gating is fully live off the bucket. The **content** side
  (zones/items/doors that filter at zone BOOT via `Expansion:CurrentExpansion`) only fully opens
  after the rule is persisted + world restarted — `aa_choice` bumps the rule live per-zone as a
  best-effort, and `event_enter_zone` calls `sync_zone()`. See `aotv4_aa.sql` step 4.
- **DB**: `aotv4_aa.sql` tags the 353-AA set Bard (`classes|128`) + `grant_only`, lowers
  `level_req 1-70 → 1`, sets `CurrentExpansion=0`. AAs load at zone boot (not shared memory) → a
  **zone restart** applies DB changes. **Reset the race**: `DELETE FROM data_buckets WHERE` key
  `='aotv4_era'`.

> ⚠️ Keep the `aa_pool.lua` generator's WHERE in step with `aotv4_aa.sql` step 2 (same filter:
> enabled, type 1-5, real-named, `expansion 0-8`, first-rank `level_req <= 70`, dedup by name) so
> **pool == tagged set**. An AA in the pool but not tagged Bard → its grant silently fails.

## 13. Player shop (permanent escrow trader) — `/trader` (was `/shop`)

An AFK player shop that works from **any city** (no Bazaar zone, no NPC, no Trader's Satchel), documented
in full in **`HANDOFF.md`**. Items are **escrowed** (they leave your bags when listed → no dupe), searchable
via the native `/bazaar`, delivered by parcel, and paid to the seller on sale (instantly if online, else
banked to next login). Managed by a **three-tab native SIDL window** (`/trader`): **Set Price** (price an
inventory item into a persistent price book + see that item's price history) / **List Item** (choose a
quantity and add a priced item to your shop) / **My Shop** (pull a listing back).

- **Protocol (chat, dll swallows all of it):** `/trader` → dll rewrites to `/say shopopen`; server replies with
  four lines — `SHOPINVDATA slot|itemid|name|vendor|stackqty|bookprice^…` (inventory + its saved price),
  `SHOPBOOKDATA itemid|name|price^…` (the price book), `SHOPLOGDATA itemid|name|old|new|when^…` (price-change
  history, newest first), `MYSHOPDATA itemsn|itemid|name|cost|qty^…` (current listings). dll → `/say
  shopsetprice <itemid>:<copper>` (persist a book price), `/say shopadd slot:qty,…` (escrow; **price comes
  from the book, NOT the command** — an unpriced item is rejected), `/say shoppull <itemsn>` (unlist →
  cursor), `/say shoprefresh`.
- **Price book (2026-07, `zone/trading.cpp`):** per-character `item_id→price` persisted in the
  `shopbook_<charid>` data bucket; a capped (20-entry) change log in `shoplog_<charid>`. `SetItemPrice`
  (upsert + append log), `GetPriceBook`, `GetPriceLog` — all Lua-bound (`lua_client.*`). `GetSellableInventory`
  now carries the book price per row; `AddItemsToShop` reads the price from the book (so `shopadd` sends only
  `slot:qty`). Rationale: you set prices once, then list from them without re-typing. **Needs a zone rebuild.**
- **Server (`zone/trading.cpp`, `Client::` + Lua-bound):** `GetSellableInventory`, `AddItemsToShop`
  (**insert rows FIRST, then delete items** — loss-safe; unique `item_sn` from the `shopsn_<charid>`
  counter because item serials change across relog), `GetMyShopListing`, `PullShopItem`. Rows persist in
  the `trader` table across logout/reboot (searchable while offline).
- **Payout is ONE place — `world/zoneserver.cpp` `ServerOP_BazaarPurchase`:** seller online (any zone) →
  native `trader_pc->AddMoneyToPP` in their zone; seller offline → bank `shop_escrow_<charid>` (paid on
  login by `bazaar_broker.pay_escrow`). ⚠️ **Never also pay in the zone buy path** — that was a 2× bug.
- **Lua:** `quests/lua_modules/bazaar_broker.lua` (backend, no NPC despite the name) + `global_player.lua`
  (`event_say` → `handle_global_say`; `event_connect` → `pay_escrow`).
- **dll (`core_spellwindow.cpp`):** the two-tab window (reuses the coin-field/scroll code); shared
  `DrawCloseX`/`CloseXRect` put a red **[X]** on the Journal/Portal/Shop windows; `IsInGame()`
  (`pinstLocalPlayer` @ `0xDD2630`) gates every overlay `WM_TIMER` so they **auto-hide off char-select**.
  `IsAoTOverlay(fg)` (window-class prefix `AoT`) makes the overlays treat **each other** as the same app
  in that `active` check, so focusing one overlay doesn't hide the others — **multiple overlays coexist**.
  The shop window is draggable across its whole top strip. `/shop` intercept is in `core_bazaar.h`
  (`areTradeAnywhereEnabled=true`).
- **Native trader window ANYWHERE — attempted, NOT viable (2026-07). The `/shop` window is the answer.**
  We tried to open the real RoF2 trader window (`CBazaarWnd`) outside the Bazaar and it **does not render**,
  even though the window *object* exists everywhere. Findings (so nobody re-treads this):
  - `pinstCBazaarWnd` @ `0xD1FCB0` / `pinstCBarterWnd` @ `0xF70CF0` are **non-null in all zones** (runtime
    Ctrl+B vtable dump) — built at UI-load. `/trader`→`0x4EAB40`, `/buyer`→`0x4E6F60` (from `__CommandList`
    @ `0xACD5A8`); the handler has no zone check — it guards `window+0x1D4` then calls the show wrapper
    `vtable[0x90]`=`0x864100` → `CXWnd::Show(1,1,1)` (`vtable[0xd8]`).
  - **But calling Show (via the handler OR directly, bypassing the `[0x1d4]` gate) shows NOTHING outside the
    Bazaar** — TESTED in-game (Ctrl+T and a `/trader` intercept both fail; `/shop` works, so the dll/detour
    is fine). `[0x1d4]` is the window's "active" state (written by Bazaar UI code @ `0x652BBA`/`0x654D28`;
    Deactivate = `0x63ADB0`). The window only renders after `CBazaarWnd::Activate` runs **on Bazaar entry**
    (positions it, wires it into the Bazaar screen). Show just re-shows an already-activated window; outside
    the Bazaar it was never activated, so nothing draws. Replicating that activation is a large, fragile,
    untestable-without-rebuild client patch — **not worth it**, especially since the Bazaar zone may not exist.
  - Leftover harmless code: the `/trader`/`/buyer` intercepts in `core_bazaar.h` (call Show → no-op visually)
    and the Ctrl+T/Ctrl+Y/Ctrl+B diagnostics in core_spellwindow.cpp. Kept as documentation of the dead end.
  - **Resolution:** the custom **`/shop`** window already delivers the full requirement (offline trader, any
    zone, NO Bazaar zone needed, global `/bazaar` search, escrow/parcel payout). It was **restyled to the
    EQ-native look** (2026-07, `VendorPaint`/`VDrawBtn`/new `VBevel` + title-bar in core_spellwindow.cpp):
    gold/tan metallic window frame (dark→bright→mid gold band), near-black background, a **gold "Trader" title
    bar** (`VTBAR_H`=24, embossed strip + gold underline, `[X]` in its top-right), sunken recessed list panel +
    raised header strip, EQ beveled-grey buttons, sunken coin input fields, alternating row bands, cream/gold
    text. ⚠️ **Layout uses shared helpers** (`VTabBtn`/`VUpBtn`/`VField`/`VActBtn`/`VRowY`/`VLIST_Y`/`hy`) for
    BOTH paint and click hit-testing — all include `VTBAR_H`, so the title-bar shift stays consistent; the drag
    region (WndProc) is the only raw-constant spot. `VDrawBtn`/`VBevel` are shared with the search window.
    **Needs a dll rebuild.**
  - **SUPERSEDED by a native SIDL window (2026-07).** The GDI restyle only *imitates* EQ chrome; the real fix
    (asked "why not use the window XML as reference?") is a **native `CCustomWnd`** — same approach as the
    achievement window (§15), which renders with the client's own UI engine so it looks truly native AND
    works in any zone. Built from the reference XMLs the user supplied (`/src/EQUI_BazaarWnd.xml` etc.):
    - **`EQUI_ShopWnd.xml`** (`aotv4_client_install/uifiles_default/`) — Screen `item="ShopWnd"` (`WDT_Def`
      frame, Titlebar/Closebox, title "Trader"), a `Listbox` (`WDT_Inner`, cols Item/Qty/Price), 4 coin
      `Editbox`es, buttons Set Price / Add to Shop / Pull Item / Refresh + Add-Items/My-Shop tabs.
    - **`ShopWnd : CCustomWnd`** (core_spellwindow.cpp) — REUSES the GDI backend (same `g_vendor*`/`g_my*`
      state + `VendorQueue`/`VendorDoAdd`); `WndNotification` maps clicks → the same `/say shopadd/shoppull/
      shoprefresh`. `EnsureShopWindow` wires `ppSidlMgr`/`ppWndMgr` from client globals (the §15 fix).
      `SHOPINVDATA` now calls `ShopSidlShow()` (was `g_vendorVisible=true`); `MYSHOPDATA`→`ShopWndRefreshIfOpen`;
      teardown `ShopWndOnUiReset()` is called from the achievement `CleanGameUI`/`ReloadUI` detour (it owns
      those). Old GDI overlay stays in the dll but is never shown.
    - ⚠️ **SIDL editbox I/O gotchas (learned the hard, crashy way) — THREE traps:**
      1. **Raw struct member offsets are WRONG for this client build.** Accessing `((CEditWnd*)w)->InputText`
         reads empty and `w->WindowText` reads a garbage pointer → `GetCXStr` on it **CRASHES**. `EQClasses.h`
         member offsets don't match this RoF2 build. Only **address-mapped METHODS** (`FUNCTION_AT_ADDRESS`) are
         reliable. So **read** an editbox via the method `w->GetWindowTextA()` (`0x411190`) and pull chars from
         the returned `CXStr` (which wraps one `CXSTR*`): `CXStr s = w->GetWindowTextA(); PCXSTR raw =
         *(PCXSTR*)&s; if (raw) GetCXStr(raw, buf, n);` (`ShopGetInt`). **Set** labels via `SetWindowTextA`
         (`ShopSetLabel`). Don't pre-fill editboxes (and `CXStr::operator char*` isn't address-bound — never cast).
      2. **Clicking a coin field clears the Listbox selection**, so at button-click `GetCurSel()` is −1 and any
         "apply to selected row" no-ops (symptom: Set Price never changes the price). Remember the row on
         list-click in `m_sel` and use `SelRow()` (single-item fallback), NOT live `GetCurSel()`.
      3. `/echo` is NOT a valid EQ command (that's an MQ2 thing) — for in-window feedback use `WriteChatColor`
         (MQ2Main.h / MQ2PluginHandler.cpp is in the build) or set a label; `/echo` returns "invalid command".
    - **Stackable quantity (2026-07):** `Client::AddItemsToShop` (trading.cpp) lists a **partial stack**
      (`item_charges = list_qty`; `DeleteItemInInventory(slot, del_qty)` where `del_qty` 0 = whole stack) so you
      can list N of a stack and keep the rest. Client shows real Qty + has a `SHW_Qty` field (default = full
      stack); state in `g_vendorStack`/`g_vListQty`/`g_myQty`. Field splitting is `VSplitN(s, out, n)` (the shop's
      old `VSplit5` was renamed — a duplicate def collided with the loot window's `VSplit5`). Buyer still
      purchases the whole listing (per-unit buys would be a bigger change). **Needs a zone rebuild + dll rebuild.**
    - **Three tabs (2026-07, `ShopWnd` in core_spellwindow.cpp):** `g_vendorTab` 0/1/2 = Set Price / List Item /
      My Shop (`SHOP_TAB_*`). One shared `SHW_ItemList`; `ApplyVis()` shows/hides each tab's controls via
      `CXWnd::Show`. Set Price → `shopsetprice`; List → `shopadd slot:qty` for the selected row (`VendorDoAdd`);
      Pull → `shoppull`. History listbox `SHW_HistList` is filtered to the selected item's id (`FillHistory`),
      relative "when" via `ShopWhenStr`. EQUI_ShopWnd.xml is CX564×CY600. **Needs a dll rebuild.**
      - ⚠️ **The "keep it to ONE listbox" and "no native tabs" rules recorded here were WRONG** — see
        §16's corrections. A second listbox failed once because that XML was malformed, not because
        the client forbids it (`EQUI_AoTSpellBook.xml` ships four), and the hand-rolled toggle-button
        tabs were unnecessary: `TabBox`/`Page`/`TabText` are stock and are what the AA window uses
        (§6). Both windows are worth rebuilding on the real widgets when they are next touched.
    - **Command: `/trader`** (core_bazaar.h) routes to `/say shopopen` → server SHOPINVDATA → `ShopSidlShow`.
      The old `/shop` and `/buyer` intercepts were **removed** (the native trader/buyer windows can't render
      standalone).
    - **Client install:** `aotv4_client_install/SHOP_WINDOW_INSTALL.md` — copy `EQUI_ShopWnd.xml` to
      `uifiles/default/` + `<Include>` it in `EQUI.xml`, rebuild the dll. Like the achievement window, expect
      a possible iteration to nail the SIDL wiring.
- ⚠️ **Bazaar search MUST be global — `common/bazaar.cpp` `Bazaar::GetSearchResults` (2026-07 fix).** Escrow
  sellers list from ANY zone (the `trader` row's `char_zone_id` is wherever they stood — never a single Bazaar
  zone), so the STOCK scope filters break trader-anywhere: `Local_Scope` restricts to the searcher's zone, and
  the `else if (trader_id > 0)` branch restricts to one `char_id`. RoF2 sends `Local_Scope`/`AllTraders_Scope`
  and populates `trader_id` from the selected trader, so **stock scoping shows each player only their own /
  their-zone listings** (symptom: "others can't see my listing; needs a relog"). Fix: for the non-alternate
  path, add **no** trader/zone filter — `search_criteria_trader` stays `"TRUE"` → all listings match (item
  name/type/cost filters still apply). Keep the NonRoF per-trader-inspect path + the (rule-gated, off) shard
  path intact. The buyer's trader **list** was already global (`GetDistinctTraders`, no zone filter when
  `UseAlternateBazaarSearch=false`). **Needs a zone rebuild** (bazaar.cpp is in `libcommon`).
- **Live visibility on list** is already wired: `AddItemsToShop` calls `SetTrader(true)` +
  `SendBecomeTraderToWorld(this, TraderOn)` → world fans `ServerOP_TraderMessaging` to every zone
  (`ZSList::SendPacket`) → each zone pushes `AddTraderToBazaarWindow` to all online RoF2 clients. So a listing
  appears in others' open bazaar windows without a relog — but the buyer must still click **Search** (the
  bazaar has no passive item feed). This only *worked* once the global-search fix above unmasked it.
- ⚠️⚠️ **The `trader` table is PERMANENT escrow storage — NEVER truncate or wholesale-delete it (2026-07).**
  A listed item is removed from the player's satchel and lives ONLY as its `trader` row, so any stock code
  that clears the table destroys REAL items (not a runtime cache like on live EQ). Five stock deletion paths
  were closed — do not reintroduce them:
  1. **`Database::ClearTraderDetails`** (`common/database.cpp`) — ran `TRUNCATE TABLE trader` on **every world
     boot** (`world_boot.cpp`), wiping ALL shops on any restart. Now only clears the transient
     `active_transaction` lock.
  2. **`Client::TraderEndTrader`** (`zone/trading.cpp`) — the stock `!persist_listings` branch did
     `DeleteWhere(char_id)`; it's called on **zoning, camp, inventory moves, invalid-item, …** (default flag
     = delete). Delete is disabled — end-trader only flips live state now.
  3. **Trader's-Satchel move** (`zone/inventory.cpp`) — moving any item in/out of a satchel `while IsTrader()`
     ended trading (→ deleted). The whole block is removed: escrowed items aren't in the satchel, so staging
     the next item to list must not disturb the shop.
  4. **Native satchel relist** (`TraderStartTrader`) / **price=0 unlist** (`UpdateTraderItemPrice`, zonedb.cpp)
     / **Bazaar-zone cycle** (`CheckToClearTraderAndBuyerTables`, entity.cpp) — dormant native-window paths,
     defensively neutered so they never wipe escrow.

  Listings are removed by EXACTLY three legit paths: **unlist (`PullShopItem`), a sale, and login
  reconciliation (`ReclaimOfflineShop`)**. All fixes are **world + zone** binaries → need a restart/cutover.
- **Do NOT resurrect** (removed on request): the Bazaar Broker NPC (2000050), the Shopkeeper stand-in NPC
  (2000051), the Trader's-Satchel `vpset/vshop` flow, or `Bazaar:UseAlternateBazaarSearch` (keep it false —
  it's Bazaar-zone-sharded, the opposite of trader-anywhere).

## 14. All classes unlocked (was Bard-only) — 2026-07 pivot

Everyone used to be forced to Bard; now all 16 classes are playable, with the 4 pure-melee classes made
into casters. Three layers had to agree (like combat skills, §4):

**(a) Client — `core_allcasters.cpp/.h`.** Its OWN translation unit, OWN detours (not piggy-backed on the
spell-window/tradeskill hooks), gated by `areAllClassesCasters` (`_options.h`). RoF2 image base `0x400000`,
addresses rebased at runtime. Four detours:
- `EQ_Character::IsSpellcaster` (**0x443F50**) → always **1**: spellbook + spell-gem bar + casting for every
  class (RoF2 hides them for Warrior/Monk/Rogue/Berserker via a class→bool table @ 0x443f90).
- `EQ_Character::Max_Mana` (**0x581E60**) → a melee `0` return becomes `level * AOTV4_MELEE_MANA_PER_LEVEL`
  (**=40**), so the mana VALUE scales like a hybrid. **Must match the server formula** (see (b)).
- mana-gauge predicate (**0x59FB90**) → always **1**: `CPlayerWnd::Draw` (0x718cf0) shows the mana GAUGE
  (`CPlayerWnd+0x22c` "PlayerMana") only when this class→bool predicate is non-zero — forcing 1 renders the
  blue bar for melee. (A SECOND caster test, distinct from IsSpellcaster.)
- `EQ_Spell::IsBardSong` (**0x432960**, `bool __stdcall(SPELL* spell, int class)`, `ret 8`) → skill-gated:
  mirrors the server's `IsBardSong` so the **reward spells cast as normal spells, not songs, even for a Bard**.
  Stock logic = "caster is a Bard AND the spell has a Bard level" (never checks skill); our reward spells
  carry a Bard level (so a Bard can memorize them) but use **skill 98**, a non-song placeholder. Detour keeps
  the stock result but only genuine song skills stay songs: **Brass 12, Singing 41, Stringed 49, Wind 54,
  Percussion 70** (SPELL::Skill is a BYTE @ **+0x270**; per-class level array @ +0x246, Bard @ +0x24e).

**(b) Server mana.** `zone/client_mods.cpp CalcMaxMana`: the pure-melee else-branch = `GetLevel() * 40`.
Keep this constant in step with the dll's `AOTV4_MELEE_MANA_PER_LEVEL` so the client gauge max == the server
mana ceiling. (Server + client use different stat formulas; a shared `level*constant` keeps them in lockstep.)

**(c) Character creation.** `char_create_combinations` restored to **all 16 classes** (was class-8-only) —
the world loads it at boot to both drive the create-screen UI (greying out disallowed classes) and validate
create requests. Source: `custom/sql/aotv4_all_classes_creation.sql` (replaces the retired
`aotv4_bard_only_creation.sql`). **World restart** required (combos load at world boot). The Bard-force block
in `global_player.event_connect` is removed — characters keep their created class.

### Custom reward spell set (43000-43149 offered + 43150+ helpers)
- Generated by `.devcontainer/custom/spells/gen_spells.py` from `spell_design.csv` (score-based auto-tiering
  across levels 1-30, `LEVEL_CAP=30`). Spells use **skill 98** (a non-song placeholder; server `IsBardSong`
  is already skill-gated). Class levels opened to all 16 classes (offer level = `classes8`).
- ⚠️ **Renumbered 50xxx → 43xxx** (RoF2 caps spell LINKS and the spellbook packet at **id < 45000**; the
  custom set was originally at 50000+). Trigger/proc refs live in `effect_base_value`/`effect_limit_value`
  and must be renumbered too (Moonfire's heal @ limit2, Firefist/Chi Block @ limit1 were missed once).
- ⚠️ **`gen_spells.py` is DESYNCED from the live DB** — still emits 50xxx and lacks the live fixes below.
  **Do a source-sync before ever regenerating** or it reverts everything. (Memory: `gen-spells-source-sync`.)
- **Two description sources, keep in sync:** the level-up **picker** reads `spell_desc.lua` (server sends it
  via `SPELLDESCDATA`); the in-game **spellbook** reads `db_str` (via `descnum=id`). ⚠️ A literal `%` in a
  description renders as garbage (`0:00:00`) — the client treats `%` as a format token; spell out "percent".
- **Descriptions live in:** `spell_design.csv` (master) → `spell_desc.lua` (gen) → `db_str` (live). Client
  needs `spells_us.txt` (class levels + cast times) + `dbstr_us.txt` (descriptions) re-exported +
  installed; the current bundle is dropped at `C:\AoTv3\AoTv4\aotv4_client_install` (== `/src/aotv4_client_install`).

### Custom melee mitigation (why "deflected by your armor" spams)
`zone/attack.cpp Mob::MeleeMitigation` (~1063) replaces stock AC mitigation with an **AC-vs-offense roll**
(`AoT:Mit*` rules). A full-mitigation roll (`rolled_mit >= 1.0`) zeroes damage and prints **"…was deflected
by your armor!"** (line 1156 — uses `GetName()`, the raw `a_cave_rat009`; should be `GetCleanName()`). A
high-AC char vs a weak mob deflects nearly every hit → message spam (it's on the filterable `OtherMissYou`
channel). Rune/mitigation buffs (SPA 55/78/161/162/163) DO still apply — via `ReduceDamage` (line 4331,
after MeleeMitigation). ⚠️ **% mitigation is imperceptible vs the tiny post-mitigation numbers** (`3 * 1/100 = 0`);
for low-level buffs prefer a **flat per-hit cap** — SPA 162 `base=100, limit=N` subtracts exactly N/hit
(how Passive Protection was fixed). Damage shields (SPA 59) use a **negative** base (native convention).

## 15. Achievements + class-aura rewards — 2026-07

A DB-defined **achievement system** (ported/adapted from the `Barathos/EQEmu-feature-achievements` fork)
whose rewards can **scribe a class aura**. The client shows a **native SIDL window**; the server owns all
progress, completion, and validation. Same "server → `ACH|...` chat line → dll → window" pattern as our
other overlays (§3/§6/§11/§13).

**Server (`zone/achievement_manager.cpp/.h`, singleton `achievement_manager`).** DB-defined objectives
(`level`/`zone_visit`/`task_complete`/`skill`/`*_kill`) tracked per character; on completion, rewards queue
(auto-claim grants immediately). Gameplay hooks call it: `attack.cpp` `NPC::Death` (3 kill sites),
`client.cpp` `SetSkill`, `exp.cpp` `SetLevel`, `client_packet.cpp` `CompleteConnect`, `task_client_state.cpp`
`IncrementDoneCount`. `#ach [window|status|categories|category|detail|rewards|claim|check]` command
(`gm_commands/achievements.cpp`). **AoTv4 additions:** an **`any_kill`** objective type (kill anything) and
**`class_mask` enforcement** in `ProcessMatchedObjectives` (`GetPlayerClassBit`, `0`=any) so per-class
achievements only advance for that class; a **`scribe_spell`** reward type in `AwardQueuedReward` (reward_id
= a spell id → scribes it into the spellbook; idempotent).
- **DB**: `custom_achievement_*` tables via `common/database/database_update_manifest_custom.h` (custom
  migrations v1-4); `common/version.h` `CUSTOM_BINARY_DATABASE_VERSION = 4`. **World applies the migration
  at boot** (not zone). Reward types: title_text/suffix/set, item, currency, coin, live_item_request,
  **scribe_spell**.
- ⚠️ **Migration pre-backup needs DB creds.** World auto-dumps the DB before applying migrations via
  `mysqldump --defaults-extra-file=login.my.cnf`; it builds that cnf from **`content_database`** creds
  (`IsDumpContentTables`). If `content_database` is absent/blank, the cnf gets empty creds → mysqldump
  auths as the OS user → **"Access denied" → migration aborts**. Fix (done): a `content_database` block
  (peq/peqpass) in `eqemu_config.json`. One-off unblock: write `login.my.cnf` (`[mysqldump]` peq creds)
  **read-only** so `BuildCredentialsFile` can't overwrite it.

**The 16 class auras (the reward).** One per class, granted by "*Class*: First Blood" (kill anything **as
that class** → scribe that class's aura). Auras (§ generic mechanic): a **cast spell** (SPA 351, self, spawns
the aura) + an **`auras` row** (cast → aura NPC → effect spell, `aura_type=1` OnAllGroupMembers = **group-
shared**, distance 60) + an **effect spell** (the group buff). Our set: cast spells **43500-43515**, effect
spells **43550-43565**, aura NPCs **2000100-2000115**; achievements **9000001-9000016** (category 9000),
objectives `any_kill` + class_mask bit, rewards `scribe_spell` → the class's cast spell. **1-active is the
default** (`GetAuraSlots()` = base 1; never grant `aura_slots` bonuses). Generated by
`/tmp` scripts (clone templates 8468/8469/2000003); to regen see `custom/spells` history.

**Client dll (`core_achievements_native.cpp/.h`, flag `areAchievementsNativeEnabled`).** The reference was a
standalone dll that re-detoured `dsp_chat`/`InterpretCmd` — **which we already own** — so it was refactored
to `.cpp`+`.h` (single definition across our TUs) and **routed through our existing detours**: our
`dsp_chat` calls `NativeAchievementParseTransport` (swallow `ACH|`) + swallows the `#ach` echo; our
`InterpretCmd` (`core_bazaar.h`) calls `NativeAchievementHandleLocalCommand` + `NativeAchievementRewriteCommand`
(`/ach …` → `/say #ach …`). `InitAchievementsNative` installs ONLY the `CDisplay::CleanGameUI`/`ReloadUI`
detours (window lifecycle) — conflict-free only because `isMQInjectsEnabled=false` (else MQ2's CleanUI hook
takes those addresses). The window is a real SIDL `CCustomWnd` (`NativeAchievementWnd`), created on demand.
- ⚠️ **This dll had NEVER used native SIDL windows** (all our overlays are self-drawn GDI), so the MQ2 UI
  managers `ppSidlMgr`/`ppWndMgr` weren't reliably wired — `CCustomWnd`/`NativeAchievementEnsureWindow`
  silently returned at `if (!pSidlMgr || !pWndMgr)` and **the window never appeared** (log stopped at
  `ACH|window|show` with no "creating achievement window"). Fix: in `NativeAchievementEnsureWindow`, set
  them directly from the client globals if unset — `ppSidlMgr = (CSidlManager**)((0x15D3D08-0x400000)+baseAddress)`,
  `ppWndMgr = (CXWndManager**)((0x15D3D00-0x400000)+baseAddress)`. Any future native-window feature in this
  dll must do the same. `native_achievements.log` (in the EQ root) is the dll's own debug trace — the fastest
  way to diagnose the window (it logs every `ACH|` line received + the `EnsureWindow` pointer values).
- **Client install** (see `aotv4_client_install/ACHIEVEMENT_WINDOW_INSTALL.md`): rebuild OUR `dinput8.dll`;
  copy `EQUI_NativeAchievementWnd.xml` + `Achievement_*.tga` to `uifiles/default/`; add
  `<Include>EQUI_NativeAchievementWnd.xml</Include>` to `EQUI.xml`. The `#ach` **text** commands work
  without any client change; the UI files are only for the native window.

**Filling out the categories (2026-07).** The seed (from the fork) populates Classic→PoP well but left header
categories showing 0/0 and later in-scope tiers empty. Fixes:
- **Parent-count rollup (code):** `LoadCategorySummaries` (`achievement_manager.cpp`) now rolls child-category
  achievements up onto their parent (`a.category_id = c.id OR a.category_id IN (children of c, enabled)`), so
  **Exploration/Hunter/Slayer/Progression/Tradeskill** headers show the sum of their leaves (277/136/385/490/72)
  instead of 0. Leaves have no children so they stay direct-only. **Needs a zone rebuild + restart.**
- **Beyond-OoW hidden (SQL, `custom/sql/aotv4_achievements_fill.sql`):** the era system caps at OoW, so the
  Dragons-of-Norrath..Rain-of-Fear Exploration (cats 209-219) + Hunter (3309-3319) categories are set
  `enabled=0` (unreachable zones; reversible if the server ever extends). `LoadCategorySummaries`'
  `WHERE c.enabled=1` drops them from the window.
- **Server Custom (cat 8), same SQL file:** class-agnostic **kill milestones** (`any_kill` 100/1k/10k/50k →
  Bloodthirsty/Warmonger/Harbinger/Reaper). `any_kill` counts every kill across the char's life (survives the
  roguelite death reset). **NB: a character is ONE class**, so an "all 16 auras" achievement would be
  unearnable — Class-Mastery auras are per-class only.
- **GoD/OoW Hunter (generated, `custom/sql/aotv4_achievements_hunter_god_oow.sql` via `/tmp/…/gen_hunter_god_oow.sh`):**
  cats 3307/3308 filled from **OUR DB's named mobs** (not Live lists — those wouldn't match our spawns). Named =
  npc_types whose name starts `#` (excl. `#Trigger`/`#Zoner`/level-99 system NPCs); `a_`/`an_`/lowercase = trash.
  One `npc_name_kill` objective per distinct clean-name (top 12 by level), `zone_id` = the sub-zone it spawns in.
  ⚠️ **`npc_name_kill` matches `o.zone_id == <zone killed in>` AND `LOWER(o.target_name) == LOWER(GetCleanName())`**
  — `GetCleanName`==`CleanMobName` (`common/strings_legacy.cpp`): `_`→space, keep `[A-Za-z`+backtick]`, **strip
  `#`/digits/apostrophes**, then we LOWER. bonzz.com gave the canonical zone list + target counts but **no mob
  names** (they live on eqresource/raidloot) — irrelevant since we source earnable targets from our own spawns.
- **Epics (cat 7, `custom/sql/aotv4_achievements_epics.sql`):** 16 achievements (one per class, epic 1.0
  weapon), completed by a **new `item_receive` objective type**. `ProcessItemReceive(client,item_id)`
  (`achievement_manager.cpp`) matches `item_receive`+`target_id`; **hooked live** in `Client::SummonItem`
  (quest turn-ins/summons) + `Client::PushItemOnCursor` (loot→cursor), and **backstopped** by
  `ProcessItemInventory` in `RecheckAutomatic` (credits already-owned epics on level/zone/#ach). class_mask
  = `1<<(class-1)` gates each to its class. Epic item ids resolved from OUR `items` DB (the weapons that
  actually exist here). **Needs a zone rebuild.**
- ⚠️ **Achievement-id ranges are NOT category-bound — check before inserting.** Zone Slayer occupies
  **700001-700448**; a first pass put Epics at 700001-700016 and `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` silently hijacked
  16 Zone Slayer rows (their `zone_kill` objectives dangled). Epics moved to **710001-710016** (objectives
  71000001+). Other ranges in use: Character 1xxx/110xx, Exploration 200xxx, Task 300xxx, Tradeskill 46xxxx,
  Creature Slayer 5xxxxx, Zone Slayer 7000xx-7004xx, Server Custom 8000xx, Meta 900xxx, Class Mastery 9000xxx,
  GoD/OoW Hunter 3307xx/3308xx. **Every category is now populated** (Epics 16, Exploration 277, Hunter 136,
  Slayer 385, Progression 490, Tradeskill 72, Server Custom 4, Character 22, Class Mastery 16, Meta 4).
- **Parent headers drill down (code):** the dll shows categories as a flat list with children indented; a parent
  (Hunter/Exploration/…) has NO direct achievements, so selecting it used to show an empty list. `LoadAchievements`
  now returns the union of the selected category + its enabled child categories (grouped by `category_id`), so
  clicking "Hunter" lists all 136. Leaves are unaffected (no children).
- ⚠️ **Live-refresh must stay small — chat-burst drops (fix).** `PushLiveUpdate` originally re-sent ALL ~40
  `ACH|category` lines per completion; the RoF2 chat pipe drops/reorders that burst, losing the trailing
  `ACH|achievement_state` row-flip → "the window updates only sometimes." Now it sends the **state flip first**,
  then only the **affected leaf + its parent** (1 status + 1 state + ≤2 category = ~4 lines). Any per-completion
  push here must stay minimal for the same reason. (A big parent drill-in still sends ~N achievement lines, same
  load as the pre-existing 490-row Task Completion leaf — if a huge list ever truncates, batch it.)
- **Native EQ-menu "Achievements" button is intentionally NOT hooked** — it opens RoF2's stock `CAchievementsWnd`
  (which we never populate), not our window. Redirecting it needs RE of the client's native-open call; by choice
  the window is opened via `#ach`/`/ach` instead.

## 16. Advanced Loot window (`/advl`) — 2026-07

A native SIDL **Advanced Loot** window in **complement mode**: the stock RoF2 loot window still opens
(`MakeLootRequestPackets` is untouched); ours lists the SAME corpse and adds **Loot / Leave / Never**,
**Loot All**, and a persistent **Never** filter list. Same "server → chat line → dll → window" pattern as
§3/§6/§11/§13/§15.

- **Protocol (chat, dll swallows all of it):** server → `LOOTDATA <n>^lootslot|itemid|icon|name|npcname|qty^…`
  (pushed from `Handle_OP_LootRequest`; `qty` = stack size for stackables else 1, appended **last** so an
  older 5-field dll parse still works), `FILTERDATA <n>^itemid|icon|name|rule^…`, `LOOTCLOSE`
  (from `Handle_OP_EndLootRequest` + `event_enter_zone`). dll → `/say alspick <lootslot> loot|leave|never`,
  `/say alslootall`, `/say alsrefresh`, `/say alsfilters`, `/say alsfilterdel <itemid>`.
- **Server (`zone/client_packet.cpp`, `Client::`):** `SendAdvLootData` / `SendAdvLootFilters` /
  `SendAdvLootClose` / `AdvLootSlot` / `HandleAdvLootSay`. The `/say als*` commands are intercepted in
  **`Client::ChannelMessageReceived`** (`zone/client.cpp`, before EVENT_SAY/broadcast) so they never spam
  chat or reach quests — **NOT** in Lua, unlike the other windows. **Needs a zone rebuild.**
- ⚠️ **Looting reuses the NATIVE `Corpse::LootCorpseItem`** — `AdvLootSlot` synthesizes an `OP_LootItem`
  packet and calls it, so lore/cursor/weight/corpse-removal are the stock checks and there is **no bespoke
  item-grant path** (the lesson from the escrow work, §13). It only works while the corpse is actually being
  looted (`LootCorpseItem` requires `IsBeingLootedBy`) — which is why this is complement mode, not a
  standalone accumulating loot list.
- **`lootslot` is the handle**, not an entity id (the dll's `g_lootEid[]` is historically misnamed).
  `Corpse::RemoveItem` does **not** renumber lootslots, so `alslootall`'s slot snapshot stays valid while
  it loots down the list.
- ⚠️ **Two traps when driving `LootCorpseItem` from a server-side batch (both fixed; don't reintroduce):**
  1. **The 10 ms loot throttle is per zone TICK.** `Corpse::m_loot_cooldown_timer(10)` is checked against
     the global `current_time`, which does **not** advance inside one packet handler — so in a tight loop
     the first `Check()` passes and resets it and **every later item fails**, each failure calling
     `SendEndLootErrorPacket` + `ResetLooter()` (Loot All would loot one item and kill the loot session).
     `Corpse::ResetLootCooldown()` (corpse.h, `Timer::Trigger()`) is called between items. Safe because
     `LootCorpseItem` removes the item from the corpse, so a slot can't be looted twice.
  2. **`auto_loot` must be 1.** With `0`, `LootCorpseItem` does `PutLootInInventory(slotCursor,…)` — every
     item piles on the **cursor**, and `Character:CheckCursorEmptyWhenLooting` (default **true**) then
     refuses the next loot *and* calls `ResetLooter()`. With `1` it uses `AutoPutLootInInventory` (free bag
     slot, cursor only as fallback). `alslootall` additionally **stops cleanly** if the cursor is occupied.
  The synthesized `OP_LootItem` carries a **server-space** lootslot; the ACK `QueuePacket(app)` runs through
  `ENCODE(OP_LootItem)` (`ServerToRoF2CorpseMainSlot`), so it keeps the native loot window in sync.
- **Never list** = data bucket `alsnever_<charid>` (CSV of item ids). A filtered item is only **omitted from
  LOOTDATA** — it stays on the corpse and still shows in the native loot window. Nothing is destroyed.
- **dll — its OWN translation unit `core_advloot.cpp/.h`** (2026-07-25; was inside `core_spellwindow.cpp`),
  like `core_allcasters` / `core_achievements_native`. Flag `areLootWindowEnabled` → `InitAdvLoot()`.
  It installs **NO detours**: the dll already owns `dsp_chat` / `InterpretCmd` / `ProcessGameEvents` and two
  modules can't hook the same address, so those call in via `AdvLootParseTransport` (LOOTDATA/FILTERDATA/
  LOOTCLOSE), `AdvLootIsOurEcho` (`/say als*` echoes), `AdvLootShow` (`/advl`, from `core_bazaar.h`) and
  `AdvLootOnUiReset` (from the `CleanGameUI`/`ReloadUI` detour `core_achievements_native.cpp` owns).
  `AdvLootWnd : CCustomWnd` over `EQUI_AdvLootWnd.xml`, with the same `ppSidlMgr`/`ppWndMgr` wiring fix as
  §15. **Static layout only** and **one listbox** (§13). The game-thread command queue is shared as
  `AoTQueueGameCommand()` (`VendorQueue` is now a wrapper on it).
  ⚠️ New `.cpp` files **must be added to `eq-core-dll-vs2022.vcxproj`** or they silently don't compile.
  The old **GDI** loot overlay was deleted (~300 lines) — it had been dead since the SIDL window landed.
- ✅ **CORRECTIONS (2026-07-25), proven by the reference sources in `src.rar` + a binary probe.** Three
  "limits" recorded here were wrong and cost real work:
  - **Native TABS exist.** `TabBox` + `Page` + `TabText` + `TabBorderTemplate`/`PageBorderTemplate` are
    all in RoF2's parser, and `FT_DefTabBorder`/`FT_DefPageBorder` are in our `EQUI_Templates.xml`.
    The Advanced Loot window hand-rolls tabs with a toggle button because this was not known.
  - **MULTIPLE Listboxes per window are fine.** `EQUI_AoTSpellBook.xml` ships four (list + detail,
    twice). The "one listbox" rule in §13 came from a malformed shop XML misdiagnosed as a hard limit;
    it forced the loot Filters view into one shared list with permanently mislabeled headers.
  - **`CListWnd::GetItemData` works** (`spellList->GetItemData(sel)` in the reference). §16's claim
    that it returns 0 for every row was a misattribution: the real fault was unassigned `lootslot`
    values aliasing every handle onto one item (see `Corpse::AssignLootSlots`).
  - Still genuinely unavailable on this build: `GetCurCol`, the `(point,row,col)` `GetItemAtPoint`
    overload, `SetColumnLabel`, and `CTextureAnimation::SetCurCell` (so no per-row item icons).
  - **Verify before believing a limit:** `strings -n 4 eqgame.exe | grep -qx "<Tag>"` answers whether
    the SIDL parser knows a tag. Validate the method with a nonsense tag first.
- ✅ **ALWAYS run `bash aotv4_client_install/validate_ui_xml.sh` before copying any `EQUI_*.xml` into
  the client.** It checks the four things that have actually broken us: `--` inside a comment, tag
  balance, undefined `<Pieces>` targets, and modern-only tags (`<Sortable>`, column `<Tooltip>`) that
  no RoF2-shipped file uses. The `--` bug has cost TWO sessions — the second time it was written into
  a comment that was itself warning about the bug. Do not trust a visual scan.
  (`<Pieces>` also accepts a type-qualified `Screen:NAME` form — the validator strips that prefix.)
- ⚠️ **A `--` inside an XML comment CRASHES the client at UI load** (bit us on `EQUI_AdvLootWnd.xml`).
  Double hyphens are illegal in XML comments; the SIDL parser aborts the **whole file** and the client
  dies before char select. Diagnose with **`UIErrorLog.txt`** in the EQ root — it names the file and the
  exact line (`ParseNodeList() SyntaxError` + `Error reading XML.`). Applies to every `EQUI_*.xml` we ship;
  use commas/single hyphens in comments. Container has no xmllint/python, so scan with
  `sed 's/<!--/«/g; s/-->/»/g' f.xml | grep -n -- "--"` (must print nothing).
- **Client install:** `aotv4_client_install/ADVLOOT_WINDOW_INSTALL.md` (copy the XML to `uifiles/default/`,
  `<Include>` it in `EQUI.xml`, rebuild the dll).

## 17c. Roaming world boss — `#worldboss` — 2026-07-26

A boss armed for a random classic dungeon; the server is told; everyone who damages it can roll on
the corpse. **No raid** — loot rights are granted directly, which disturbs nobody's group and covers
latecomers. Pure Lua + SQL, no C++. **Test plan + known failure points: `WORLD_BOSS.md`.**

- **Files**: `lua_modules/aotv4_worldboss.lua` (core), `lua_modules/commands/worldboss.lua` (`#worldboss`
  / `status` / `clear`, access **200**), `custom/sql/aotv4_worldboss.sql`
  (npc **2000200 `#The_Nameless`**, loottable 200020). Hooks: `global_player.event_enter_zone` →
  `on_enter_zone`, `global_npc.event_death_complete` → `on_death`.
- ⚠️⚠️ **A LUA COMMAND IS REGISTERED IN `lua_modules/command.lua`, NOT in `command_settings`.** That
  table is for **C++ commands only** — the zone deletes any row whose command has no C++ handler,
  logging *"Command [x] no longer exists. Deleting orphaned entry from `command_settings`"*. A file
  in `lua_modules/commands/` that is not listed in `command.lua`'s `commands` table is simply never
  reachable. **`#worldboss` was unregistered and therefore did nothing from the day it was written
  until 2026-07-27**, which is also why it was never caught: it was only ever going to fail the
  moment somebody typed it. `commands["name"] = { access, require("commands/file") }`.
- ⚠️ **ARMING AND SPAWNING ARE SEPARATE, and must be.** You cannot spawn into a zone nobody occupies:
  zones are dynamic (idle ones self-terminate) and `eq.spawn2` is zone-local. So the command records
  `aotv4_worldboss = "zone|npcid|expiry"` in a GLOBAL bucket + announces, and the **first player to
  enter that zone spawns it** — on their own coordinates, which guarantees valid placement in any
  zone with no per-zone spawn-point table. The bucket is cleared BEFORE spawning so two simultaneous
  arrivals can't both spawn one. Lapses after `WINDOW_MINS`.
- ⚠️ **Raid is READ-ONLY from Lua** — `Lua_Raid` has no `AddMember` binding (the C++
  `Raid::AddMember` exists). Auto-raid would need a new binding; that's why loot rights were chosen
  instead. `corpse:AddLooter(mob)` + `mob:GetHateList()` are both bound, and `MAX_LOOTERS = 72`.
- ⚠️ **Region locking still applies** — a boss in a region nobody has unlocked is unreachable. Keep
  `M.ZONES` inside open regions.
- Zone list = expansion 0, ≥25 spawn points, **zero merchant NPCs** (good "not a city" proxy), minus
  the gated planes → 14 classic dungeons.
- 📌 Tuning (level 50 / 120k hp) and the 5-item placeholder loot pool are **guesses until it is
  fought**. Scheduling is deliberately not built yet — GM command only.

## 17b. Shield Wall — `/shield` damage splitting — 2026-07-26

Several players share one monster's melee damage. **Player-facing doc: `SHIELD_WALL.md`.**
Built by opening up the native `/shield` (Warrior-only, 12s, one shielder) rather than writing a
parallel system — the native path already does the pairing, the distance break and the teardown.

- **Split maths** (`Mob::ApplyShieldWall`, `zone/attack.cpp`): `share = damage * (100 + penalty*(N-1))
  / (N*100)`. Penalty 20 → 2 sharers take **60% each** (120% total), 3 take ~47% (140%). Sharing is
  deliberately **lossy**: it converts one spike into several survivable hits at a cost in total HP,
  so stacking bodies is progressively worse value. Everyone takes the **same** share incl. the aggro
  holder — the stock shielder mitigation is NOT applied on top, or the tank would take more than the
  helpers. ⚠️ Multiply before dividing or small hits truncate to nothing.
- ⚠️ **Stock allows exactly ONE shielder** (`m_shielder_id`; `ShieldAbility` rejects a second with
  `ALREADY_SHIELDED`). Added `m_shield_wall` (vector on the TARGET) as the source of truth, with
  `m_shielder_id` kept in sync with its head so every native teardown path still works. Distance is
  re-checked **per hit**, which is what makes a permanent pairing safe.
- ⚠️ **`/shield` is now a TOGGLE** (`Handle_OP_Shielding`). With a permanent duration there was
  otherwise no way to stop short of walking away or dying. Toggling off costs no recast.
- "Permanent" = an 86400000 ms timer, not a disabled one — `ShieldAbilityFinish()` keys off
  `shield_timer` to tear down cleanly.
- Rules: `AoT:ShieldAnyClass` / `ShieldMinLevel` / `ShieldPermanent` / `ShieldRecastSeconds` /
  `ShieldDistance` / `ShieldWallPenaltyPercent` / `ShieldWallMaxSharers`. **Needs a zone rebuild.**
- **Visible "Shielded" buffs** = spells **43380-43382** (`custom/sql/aotv4_shield_wall_buff.sql`),
  inert markers rebuilt by `ShieldWallRefreshBuff()` on every wall change.
  ⚠️ **One spell id PER SHIELDER, not one for the wall.** EQ will not stack the same spell id from
  two different casters — a second cast of 43380 overwrites the first — so three identical rows with
  distinct `spellgroup`s are needed for three shielders to each show as their own buff. Count must
  track `AoT:ShieldWallMaxSharers` minus 1; extra shielders beyond the row count go uncredited.
  ⚠️ It lives at **43380 (helper band 43350+)**, NOT 43300-43349 — the pool generator pulls that band
  wholesale and would offer "Shielded" as a level-up reward.
  ⚠️ **Cast it FROM THE SHIELDER, never via `ApplySpellBuff`.** That helper does
  `SpellOnTarget(spell_id, this)` on the *buff holder*, so the buff records the shielded player as
  its own caster and inspecting it reads "cast by yourself". Buffs carry `casterid` + `caster_name`
  (`Buffs_Struct`, `zone/common.h:228`) and the client shows them on inspect — casting from the
  shielder is what puts a name there. (The buff's *name* is still fixed by the spell row; the caster
  field is the part that identifies who.) `ShieldWallRefreshBuff()` re-applies from the head of the
  wall whenever it changes, so it never credits someone who has already stopped.
  ⚠️ Three places mutate the wall — `ShieldWallRemove`, the per-hit distance prune in
  `ApplyShieldWall`, and `ShieldAbilityClearVariables` — **all three must fade/refresh the buff** or
  it strands on the player.
- ⚠️ **UNTESTED at runtime** as of writing — it compiles and links, but nothing has swung at a
  shielded pair yet.
- 📌 **TODO — the Shielded buffs are PLACEHOLDERS.** Using real buff slots to display transient state
  works but is the wrong long-term shape: it burns a buff slot per shielder, caps at however many
  spell rows exist (43380-43382), and every future short-lived effect would need its own throwaway
  spell row the same way. **Build a proper tracker for short buffs / autoskills** — a purpose-made
  display fed from server state rather than the buff bar — and move Shield Wall onto it. Same problem
  already shows up in the inert-marker buffs elsewhere (43022 Divine Aura, 43035 Blade Turn, 43056
  Counterattack, the Thirst line): they exist to be *seen*, not to do anything.

## 17. Database access from Windows + container recovery — 2026-07-24

### Connecting a GUI client (HeidiSQL) to the peq DB
MariaDB runs **inside the dev container** (`eqemu_config.json` → `127.0.0.1:3306`; there is no separate DB
container). To reach it from Windows it is published as a **real Docker port**, exactly like the EQ ports:

- `devcontainer.json` `appPort`: **`"127.0.0.1:3307:3306"`** → HeidiSQL connects to **`127.0.0.1:3307`**,
  user `peq` / `peqpass`. Host-side bind is loopback, so the DB is reachable from Windows only, never the LAN.
- ⚠️ **Do NOT use `forwardPorts` / the VS Code PORTS tunnel for MySQL.** It was `forwardPorts: [3306]` and it
  **does not work**: MySQL is a **server-speaks-first** protocol (the server sends the greeting before the
  client says anything), and the tunnel fails exactly there → HeidiSQL reports **"Lost connection to server at
  'handshake: reading initial communication packet'"**. In the PORTS panel a tunnel shows Origin
  `Dev Containers`; a published port shows **`Statically Forwarded`** (what 5998/5999/7000-7005/9000 use, which
  is why the EQ client always worked). `forwardPorts` was removed so it can't also grab 3307 and shift the port.
- ⚠️ Three things must ALL be true or you get a *different* wall each time:
  1. **`bind-address = 0.0.0.0`** in the container. Stock is `127.0.0.1` (`50-server.cnf:27`), and a published
     port forwards to `eth0` where nothing would be listening. Set via a drop-in
     `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/99-aotv4.cnf` written by **`postStartCommand`** — an edit made by hand inside
     the container lives on the **container layer** and is silently lost on the next rebuild.
  2. **A `peq'@'%'` grant.** A published port arrives from the **docker gateway (172.17.0.1)**, NOT loopback,
     so the stock `peq'@'127.0.0.1'` user does not match → "Access denied for user 'peq'". Both users now exist.
  3. **Right port.** Connecting to `127.0.0.1:3306` on Windows hits whatever local MySQL owns 3306 (that's WHY
     VS Code picked 3307) — the tell is `Access denied for user 'peq'@'localhost'`, i.e. a *different server*
     answering, not a credential problem.
- `postStartCommand` also **starts MariaDB on every container start**, so it no longer has to be started by hand.

### A rebuild does NOT destroy the DB — the OLD CONTAINER STILL HAS IT
The `aotv4-mysql-data` volume (§2) was committed **Jul 21 02:45** but a mount only takes effect on the next
rebuild, and none happened until **Jul 24 22:31** — so the DB lived on the *container layer* for those 3 days
and the fresh container came up with an empty volume. **The data was never lost**: the previous container was
still there (stopped or even running) with its datadir intact. Before importing any snapshot, **check the old
containers first** — a snapshot import silently costs every day of work since the snapshot was taken.

```powershell
docker ps -a --format "{{.ID}}  {{.CreatedAt}}  {{.Status}}  {{.Image}}"   # incl. stopped; image vsc-aotv4-*
foreach ($c in "<ids>") { docker exec -u root $c sh -c "ls /var/lib/mysql | tr '\n' ' '; echo" }
docker exec -u root <ID> sh -c "du -sh /var/lib/mysql/peq; ls -l /var/lib/mysql/peq/character_data.ibd; ls /var/lib/mysql/peq | grep -c custom_achievement"
docker exec -u root <ID> sh -c "service mariadb start; sleep 8; mysqldump --single-transaction --routines --events --databases peq | gzip > /tmp/peq_recovered.sql.gz"
docker cp <ID>:/tmp/peq_recovered.sql.gz C:\AoTv3\AoTv4\peq_recovered.sql.gz
```
- ⚠️ **`docker exec` MUST use `-u root`.** Dev-container images default to user `vscode`, and the per-database
  dirs are `drwx------ mysql` → `du /var/lib/mysql/peq` returns **Permission denied**. A check written as
  `du … || echo "no peq db"` therefore reports **"no DB" on a container that has the full database** — this
  cost an hour and nearly triggered a needless snapshot import.
- **Pick the right container by evidence, not by name:** `du` size (live DB ≈ 750 MB), `character_data.ibd`
  mtime (the newest = last session; InnoDB flushes lazily so the mtime lags the true last write), and a
  `custom_achievement*` file count > 0 (proves the Jul-23 achievement work is in it).
- MariaDB will not be running in an old container (PID 1 is the sleep loop) — that is normal, `service mariadb
  start` first. Its startup runs **InnoDB crash recovery**, replaying `ib_logfile0`, which is exactly why you
  dump from a started server instead of copying the datadir files.
- Verify a dump before trusting it: `gzip -dc x.sql.gz | grep -c "^CREATE TABLE"` (expect **233** now — 223
  pre-achievements) and a `Dump completed on …` marker at the tail. **36 MB gzipped ≈ 341 MB SQL is normal.**
- **Canonical recovery point is now `/src/peq_recovered.sql.gz`** (Jul 24 23:18, full `peq`, achievements
  included), NOT the stale `/src/aotv4_current.sql` (Jul 21) that `POST_REBUILD_RECOVERY.md` used to point at.

## 18. Server-wide buffs — `#worldbuff` — 2026-07-27

`#worldbuff <spellid> [minutes]` puts any spell on everybody, everywhere. Also `status` and `clear`.
Access **200**. Pure Lua, no C++.

- **Files**: `lua_modules/aotv4_worldbuff.lua` (core), `lua_modules/commands/worldbuff.lua` (the
  command), registered in `lua_modules/command.lua`. Hooks: `global_player.event_connect` and
  `event_enter_zone` → `on_player`, `event_timer "worldbuff"` → `on_sweep`.
- ⚠️ **THERE IS NO SINGLE CALL THAT REACHES THE WHOLE SERVER.** Lua can only enumerate clients in its
  OWN zone (`eq.get_entity_list():GetClientList()`), and every zone is a separate process. The
  cross-zone bindings are all targeted — `cross_zone_cast_spell_by_char_id` / `_client_name` /
  `_group_id` / `_guild_id` / `_raid_id` / `_expedition_id` — there is no "by everyone". So coverage
  is assembled from four places: the command buffs its own zone at once, `event_connect` catches
  logins, `event_enter_zone` catches zoning, and a per-client repeating timer catches the player who
  is parked somewhere and does neither.
- State is ONE global bucket, `aotv4_worldbuff = "spellid|expiry_epoch"`, so every zone reads the
  same thing and it survives restarts. Same shape as `aotv4_worldboss`.
- ⚠️ **`ApplySpellBuff`, not `SpellFinished`.** `SpellFinished` runs a real cast: it can be resisted
  and it honours target type, so a beneficial spell with the wrong `targettype` will not land on an
  arbitrary player. `ApplySpellBuff` puts the buff straight on, which is what "the GM said everyone
  gets this" has to mean — and it is why **any** spell id works rather than only self/single-target.
- ⚠️ The sweep re-checks with `FindBuff` before applying, so it does not reset the duration every
  tick; a 10-minute buff lasts 10 minutes, not as long as the window.
- ⚠️ **The timer is PER CLIENT**, so `on_sweep` does per-client work. Calling `apply_zone()` from it
  would walk the whole client list once per player per sweep.
- `clear` stops new grants; buffs already handed out run out on their own.

## 19. Autoskill window — `/autoskill` — 2026-07-27

⚠️ **The autoskill SYSTEM predates this and was NOT changed.** It was already: `GetAvailableAutoSkills`
(the ten activated specials), `GetAutoSkillsList` (those you have), `Get/SetAutoSkillStatus`
(per-skill on/off in `autoskill.<id>` data buckets), and the auto-fire loop in `Client::Process` that
runs enabled specials while auto-attacking a **non-client** target. `#autoskill [skill]
[enable|disable|status]` / `#autoskill list` still work untouched. Section 19 is only the **window**.

- **Server**: `Client::SendAutoSkillData` / `HandleAutoSkillSay` / `GetAutoSkillCooldown` /
  `GetAutoSkillReuse`, all in `zone/special_attacks.cpp`; say intercept in
  `Client::ChannelMessageReceived` beside the AdvLoot one. **Needs a zone rebuild.**
- **Client**: `core_autoskill.cpp/.h` (own TU, no detours) + `EQUI_AoTAutoSkillWnd.xml`, flag
  `areAutoSkillWindowEnabled`. `/autoskill` from `core_bazaar.h`. Install:
  `aotv4_client_install/AUTOSKILL_WINDOW_INSTALL.md`.
- **Protocol**: `ASKILLDATA <n>^skillid|name|enabled|cooldown_secs|reuse_secs^…` out;
  `/say askset <skillid> <0|1>` and `/say askrefresh` in.
- ⚠️ **`GetAutoSkillCooldown` lives in `special_attacks.cpp` on purpose** — `AOTV4_SKILL_TIMER_BASE`
  is file-scope there, and duplicating it elsewhere is how the two silently drift apart.
- ⚠️⚠️ **TAUNT USES A DIFFERENT TIMER.** Every other special uses `AOTV4_SKILL_TIMER_BASE + skill`;
  Taunt runs on the stock `pTimerTaunt` (the auto-fire loop special-cases it for the same reason).
  Reading the wrong one reports a permanently-ready Taunt.
- ⚠️⚠️ **`PersistentTimer::GetRemainingTime` returns `0xFFFFFFFF` when the timer exists but is
  DISABLED**, not 0. Unguarded, a ready skill displays a 49-day cooldown. (`PTimerList` returns a
  plain 0 for a timer that was never created at all, which is fine.) Reuse times are **seconds**
  (`BashReuseTime = 5`, `common/features.h`).
- ⚠️ **The countdown runs CLIENT-side.** The server sends remaining seconds; the dll ticks them down
  per frame and resyncs every 2.5 s **only while the window is on screen**. Streaming a line per
  second per player is exactly the chat burst RoF2 drops (§15). Closed window, zero traffic.
- ⚠️⚠️ **THE TIMERS TAB IS GONE (2026-07-28) and should not come back in that shape.** It listed the
  firing skills with Ready In and Reuse columns, and that does not work: **Bash and Kick reuse in about
  FIVE SECONDS** (`BashReuseTime = 5`, `common/features.h`), so the number was ready again before the
  eye found it and the page looked permanently broken. A grid of buttons with the countdown drawn on
  each face was tried next and was not wanted either. The window is now a SINGLE page, no `TabBox`.
- ✅ **The real lever is a CAP, not a display.** `AOTV4_AUTOSKILL_MAX = 4` (`zone/special_attacks.cpp`)
  limits how many abilities may be enabled at once, enforced in `Client::HandleAutoSkillSay` -- the
  only path that turns one on. Without it the correct play is to enable everything and the choice of
  which specials to run stops being a choice. ⚠️ Enforced SERVER side on purpose: a client-side cap is
  bypassed by the `/say askset` the window sends, or by typing `#autoskill`. Turning one OFF is always
  allowed. The dll mirrors it in `AUTOSKILL_CAP` only so "All On" does not ask for a fifth and collect
  a red refusal per extra skill.
- Cooldowns are still parsed and ticked locally even though nothing shows them, so a future short-buff
  / autoskill tracker (§17b) finds them already running.
- ⚠️ **The list is rebuilt only when the rows change** (skill gained, or one toggled) — `Refresh()`
  calls `DeleteAll`, which clears the selection, so rebuilding on every resync would yank it out
  from under the player. Otherwise only the timer column is rewritten.

## 20. Spell window tabs — Choose / Known / Pool — `/journal` — 2026-07-27

⚠️ **This began as a SEPARATE window and is not one any more.** `EQUI_AoTSpellJournalWnd.xml` and a
`SpellJournalWnd` class existed for one iteration, then the two panels were folded into the EXISTING
reward picker so there is a single spell window. The standalone XML is kept as a backup and is
**unused** — do not copy it or `<Include>` it. `core_spelljournal.cpp` now owns **no window**: it is
the data and rendering service behind two tabs whose widgets belong to `core_spellchoice_native.cpp`.

**Three tabs**: **Choose** (the reward cards, icons and two-step Confirm — UNCHANGED),
**Known**, **Pool**. **Known** = what this character has scribed, grouped under
level-band headers. **Pool** = what can still be OFFERED at a chosen level, with a `<<`/`>>` stepper.
The Pool tab is the point: the pool is **2,154 spells over 78 levels** and was previously invisible —
a player could only ever see what they had been handed, never what they might be.

- **Files**: `core_spelljournal.cpp/.h` (own TU, no detours, no window) + the Known/Pool widgets in
  the GENERATED `EQUI_AoTSpellChoiceWnd.xml`, flag `areSpellJournalEnabled`. `/journal` and
  `/spells` from `core_bazaar.h` call `SpellChoiceOpen()`. Server: `spell_choice.send_pool` /
  `handle_journal_say`, routed from `global_player.event_say`. Install:
  `aotv4_client_install/SPELL_JOURNAL_INSTALL.md`.
- **Protocol**: `SJPOOLDATA <level> <chunk> <chunks>^id:known,id:known,…` out; `/say sjpool <level>` in.
- ⚠️⚠️ **The Pool tab lists TWO pools, and combat abilities are the second one.** `spell_pool.lua` is
  spells only; the activated combat abilities live in `skill_pool.lua` and were invisible on the tab
  until 2026-07-28, which read as "not obtainable" — wrong, the picker spends a slot on one roughly
  every eighth level. They ride the same line as **`k<skillid>:<known>:<name>`** and the client lifts
  them to **`SJ_SKILL_BASE (1000000) + skillid`** so one `sjinfo <id>` can ask about either kind.
  ⚠️ Without the offset a skill id (0-76) *is* a valid spell id — `sjinfo 8` would describe spell 8.
  ⚠️ The **name is on the wire** because this dll has no skill-name table; hardcoding one is the
  `kIcons[]` drift trap again (§3). ⚠️ `SKILL_ID_BASE` (spell_choice.lua) and `SJ_SKILL_BASE`
  (core_spelljournal.cpp) must match. Abilities are **not level-banded** (`rotatable_for(class)`
  ignores level), so they list once at the top for every level; a class never sees its own natives.
- ⚠️ **Bard songs ARE in the pool** (150 of them, ~1-2 per level, only 3 blacklisted) — they are just
  sparse and carry no marker, so "no songs" is nearly always "did not spot one" rather than a filter.
- **Adapted from `New folder (2)/AoT_Spell_Book.cpp`** (an earlier AoT generation). That window is
  where the two-native-tabs + four-listboxes layout was first proven on this client — it is the file
  §16 cites. What was deliberately NOT taken:
  - its **progression model** (one spell slot per character level, tiers of 5, a Roll button, mastery
    ranks bit-packed into synthetic spell ids: `15-13` mastery / `12-8` tier / `7-0` index). Ours
    scribes real `spells_new` rows chosen three at a time on level-up; none of that machinery applies.
  - its **transport** — it talks over opcodes (`0x196A`/`0x196B`, range 6500-6504). This dll has **no
    raw-packet send at all** and every window it owns rides the shared `dsp_chat` detour.
- ✅ **Descriptions are built CLIENT SIDE** from the client's own spell record (`GetSpellByID`, then
  `Attrib[]`/`Base[]`/`DurationType`). This is the technique worth having from that reference. It
  removes the standing two-source problem in §14: the picker's text comes from `spell_desc.lua` over
  `SPELLDESCDATA` while the spellbook's comes from `db_str` via an exported `dbstr_us.txt`, and those
  must be kept in sync by hand. Text derived from the spell cannot drift from it and costs no traffic.
  ⚠️ The SPA label table is deliberately NOT exhaustive — an unknown SPA falls through to a generic
  `SPA n: base` line so it is visibly unlabelled rather than silently absent.
- ⚠️ **IDS ONLY on the wire; the client resolves names.** Sending names would roughly quadruple the
  payload (level 70 holds 125 pool spells: ~1.1 KB as `id:known` vs ~4 KB with names).
- ⚠️ **And it is CHUNKED anyway (60/line).** An oversized chat line is silently TRUNCATED, which looks
  like a short pool rather than an error — and §15 already records RoF2 dropping/reordering bursts.
  Each line carries its own chunk index, and a chunk whose level ≠ the level on screen is **dropped**
  (chat can arrive out of order; without that guard two levels would merge into one list).
- ⚠️ **Row index is NOT a data index on either list** — Known inserts a band header every 10 levels,
  so both lists keep an explicit row→spell-id map. Same trap as the Autoskill Timers page (§19).
- ⚠️ **An all-254 spell shows "Handled by the server; no client-visible effects."**, not "no effects".
  Several of ours are deliberate inert marker buffs paid by Lua (the Thirst line 43342-43347, the
  Shield Wall buffs). The wording is deliberate.
- The Known tab costs **zero** server traffic — it reads `CHARINFO2::SpellBook` directly.

### ⚠️⚠️ 43000-43149 is RETIRED from the pool (2026-07-27)
The generator's clause that offered the 20 all-slots-254 members of that band is **removed** — see
the comment block in `gen_stock_pool.pl`. That band is the retired 113-spell custom reward set
(Ember, Zap, Kick, Strike, Counterattack, Moonfire…): mostly redundant with native spells, and being
inert markers they render as "no effects" in any client-side description. Pool went 2,174 → **2,154**.
The **rows remain in `spells_new`** (dormant; referenced by their `quests/global/spells/43xxx.lua`
scripts and the 43150-43199 helpers) — only the offering stopped. Full restore of all 202 custom rows
is `custom/sql/aotv4_custom_spells_backup.sql`.

⚠️⚠️ **"Get rid of the 43xxx spells" must NEVER be read as the whole range.** The band is not
homogeneous and everything from 43300 up is live: **43300-43349** the custom spell lines (reptile,
sloth, moonfire, promised, kindred, mark, thirst — all still offered), **43350-43399** their triggers
plus the Shield Wall buffs, **43400-43454** the AA-tree buffs and pet wards, **43500-43565** the class
auras. Deleting the range would destroy all four AA trees, Shield Wall, the pet wards and the
achievement auras.

### The tabs live in the GENERATED picker XML (`gen_choice_xml.pl`)
⚠️ `EQUI_AoTSpellChoiceWnd.xml` is generated, so the Known/Pool widgets are emitted by
`aotv4_client_install/gen_choice_xml.pl`, NOT hand-written. Rerun it after any pool regen (it already
had to be rerun for the icon set) and copy the result. The generator now emits three `<Page>`s inside
one `<TabBox>`.
⚠️ **The `<Screen>` lists ONLY `ASC_Tabs`.** Every other piece belongs to a page; naming one on the
screen as well places it twice and it draws outside its tab.
⚠️ The card coordinates were NOT moved — each page sits at `Y=TAB_Y` (22) and its pieces are
positioned relative to the page, so the Choose layout is byte-for-byte the old one. The window grew
450 → 500 tall to pay for the tab strip.
- `SpellChoiceShow()` still refuses to open with nothing pending (Ctrl+Q's "is a reward owed" test
  keeps its meaning); **`SpellChoiceOpen()`** is the new browse entry point that ignores that.
- The transport calls back via `SjSetPoolReadyCallback` rather than touching the window, so
  `core_spelljournal` stays ignorant of who owns the widgets.

### ⚠️⚠️ Forward-declaring a client widget type in one of OUR headers
`core_spelljournal.h` was the first header in this dll to take a `CListWnd*`/`CXWnd*` in a signature,
and the obvious way to do it is wrong:
```cpp
class CListWnd;   // WRONG -- declares a second, unrelated ::CListWnd
```
The client classes live in **`namespace EQClasses`**, and `EQClasses.h` ends (line ~6973) with
`using namespace EQClasses;`. A global forward declaration therefore creates a *different* type, and
every later mention becomes **`'CListWnd': ambiguous symbol`** plus
**`cannot convert from 'EQClasses::CXWnd *' to 'CXWnd *'`** — over a hundred errors from one line,
almost all of them cascades that point nowhere near the cause.
```cpp
namespace EQClasses { class CListWnd; class CXWnd; }   // RIGHT
void SjRefreshKnown(EQClasses::CListWnd* list);        // and QUALIFY the signatures
```
Qualify rather than adding a global `using`, so the header works whether it is included before or
after `EQClasses.h`. Inside a `.cpp` the bare names are fine — `MQ2Main.h` pulls the using-directive
in first.

## 21. Launcher — `/aot` — 2026-07-27

One button per custom window, so none of them needs a remembered slash command. A narrow vertical
strip meant to sit under the stock **SC / EQ** buttons so it reads as part of that bar; draggable,
and the client persists its position, so it is placed once.

- **Files**: `core_aotmenu.cpp/.h` (own TU, no detours) + `EQUI_AoTMenuWnd.xml`, flag
  `areAoTMenuEnabled`. `/aot` and `/menu` from `core_bazaar.h`.
- **Buttons**: Spells, Autoskill, Adv Loot, Trader, Achievements, Search, Last Death.
- ⚠️ **Two different open mechanisms, and the split is deliberate.** Windows whose module exposes a
  show function are called directly (`SpellChoiceOpen`, `AutoSkillShow`, `AdvLootShow`,
  `ShowSearchWindow`, `LostWindowShow`). Windows whose CONTENTS come from the server are opened by
  **queueing their command** instead — Trader (`/trader` → `SHOPINVDATA`) and Achievements (`/ach` →
  `ACH|window|show`). Calling their internal show directly would put an EMPTY window on screen, and
  for the shop it would show the last stale listing.
- ✅ **It DOCKS to the left of the stock SC / EQ bar** on every open, so both are usable and neither
  covers the other. The bar is `EQMainWnd` and the client keeps a pointer at **`pinstCEQMainWnd`**
  (`eqgame.h` 0xF713C0), already in the address table -- so nothing is found by name and nothing stock
  is hooked. `CXWnd::GetScreenRect` (0x8638D0) and `CXWnd::Move(CXRect)` (**`CXWnd__Move1_x`**,
  0x8686F0) are both mapped on this build. ⚠️ `CXWnd__GetClientRect_x` is **NOT** defined here -- use
  GetScreenRect.
  ⚠️⚠️ **`CXRect::A,B,C,D` are left/top/right/bottom and are `DWORD` -- UNSIGNED.** Cast to `int`
  before any arithmetic: `bar.A - width` wraps to ~4 billion when the bar sits near the left edge,
  flinging the window off screen instead of clamping. If there is no room on the left it flips to the
  bar's right.
  ⚠️ Docking runs on OPEN, not per frame -- a per-frame reposition would fight the player dragging the
  window. Move the EQ bar, then reopen the launcher to re-dock.
- ⚠️⚠️ **DO NOT PUT BUTTONS INTO THE STOCK SC / EQ BAR. IT WAS TRIED AND IT CRASHES.** An `EQM_AoTButton`
  was added to `EQUI_EQMainWnd.xml` and its click caught by copying `EQMainWnd`'s vtable and
  overwriting **entry 34** (the slot `SetWndNotification` writes) -- necessary because
  `CCustomWnd::ReplacevfTable` only ever operates on `this`. **It crashed on the first click.** The
  code and the XML edit are both reverted; `EQUI_EQMainWnd.xml` is back to stock and is NOT shipped.
  Do not re-attempt: it patches a window this dll did not construct, on a build whose UI structs are
  already documented as not matching the headers (§13), and it can only fail at runtime -- there is no
  static check that would have caught it. The list is our OWN window, which gets notifications the
  ordinary way and cannot corrupt anything stock.
- **It auto-shows once per session** on entering the world (`AoTMenuTick` watching `pinstLocalPlayer`),
  then stays closed if closed. `AoTMenuOnUiReset` re-arms it so it survives a `/loadskin`.

### ⚠️⚠️ Listbox text colours are `0xAARRGGBB` — the ALPHA byte is mandatory (2026-07-28)
A colour written **`0x00RRGGBB` is fully transparent**, so the text is drawn and is completely
invisible. The Autoskill window showed an empty red selection bar and no skills at all for this
reason, and the spell Known/Pool tabs had the same fault. Use **`0xFF……`**. `core_advloot.cpp` and
`core_achievements_native.cpp` were already correct (`0xFFE0DCCD` etc.), which is why they looked fine
and made the others look like a data problem rather than a colour one.
⚠️ Second, separate trap in the same place: **`CListWnd::AddString` colours COLUMN 0 ONLY.** A cell
written afterwards with `SetItemText` has no colour and draws **black**. Every extra column needs an
explicit `SetItemColor(row, col, colour)` — the `Cell()` helpers in `core_autoskill.cpp` and
`core_spelljournal.cpp` now take a colour and do both.

### Blacklist as of 2026-07-28 — 619 pruned, **2008 offerable**
```
travel 170 · discipline 157 · summonitem 183 · illusion 23 · vision 19
enchant 20 · rez 15 · ldon 18 · curecurse 7 · corpse 3 · sense 3 · truenorth 1
```
- ⚠️ **`discipline` MIRRORS `common/spdat.cpp IsDiscipline` EXACTLY** — `mana = 0 AND (EndurCost > 0 OR
  EndurUpkeep > 0)`. Do not simplify it to "has an endurance cost": that would misclassify anything
  carrying both, and the rule must agree with what the ENGINE calls a discipline or the picker and the
  grant path disagree.
  Disciplines are excluded because they are not spells and do not behave like one: a picked discipline
  trains into the **Combat Abilities** window, not the spellbook, and autoskill cannot fire it either —
  that handles only the ten activated specials in `Client::GetAvailableAutoSkills`. A reward that lands
  somewhere the player is not looking, driven by none of our systems, is not a reward. Throw Stone,
  Leg Strike, Head Strike and Provoke were all being offered this way.
- ⚠️ **Rule ORDER decides which bucket a spell is counted in.** Adding `discipline` moved 16 spells out
  of `summonitem` (199 → 183): they matched both. The counts are per-rule-first-match, not disjoint
  categories — a shifting count in one bucket after adding a rule is expected, not a regression.
- ⚠️ `truenorth`, `sense`, `illusion` and `vision` all test PURITY: pruned only when the junk effect is
  the ONLY thing the spell does. A spell that senses/disguises/points north AND does something real is
  kept. Any new rule of that kind gets the same treatment.

### ⚠️⚠️ Syntax-check Lua before restarting zones — `.devcontainer/custom/tools/luacheck`
The container ships **no `lua` or `luac` binary**, so for most of this project's life a broken quest
module could only be found by restarting zones and reading a player's CHAT log. That is how a mangled
string literal in `spell_choice.lua` took down the **entire** level-up picker: `global_player.lua`
`require`s it at line 4, so the failed module aborted the whole global player script, and the only
symptom was `error loading module 'spell_choice'` in game.

`luacheck.c` builds against the system Lua 5.1 and calls `luaL_loadfile`, which parses and compiles
but never RUNS the file — so quest scripts full of `eq.*` calls are safe to check.

```bash
cc -O1 -o .devcontainer/custom/tools/luacheck .devcontainer/custom/tools/luacheck.c \
   -I/usr/include/lua5.1 -llua5.1
find .devcontainer/repo/quests -name '*.lua' -print0 | xargs -0 .devcontainer/custom/tools/luacheck
```

⚠️⚠️ **DO NOT EDIT LUA WITH `perl -0pi -e`.** Both corruptions came from that: perl interpolates
`$"`, `$+` and friends inside the replacement, and a Lua pattern is *full* of them —
`"^sjinfo%s+(%d+)%s*$"` became `"^sjinfoH  PA u+(1990222272+)  +z * )`. It also silently inlined the
whole slurped file into `gen_stock_pool.pl` when a `$_` appeared in a replacement. Use the Edit tool,
or single-quoted `sed` with explicit line numbers, and run luacheck afterwards either way.

-- aotv4_aa_melee_hosted.sql -- the Melee tree, HOSTED ON NATIVE AA ROWS.
-- =============================================================================================
-- Read the header of aotv4_aa_tank_hosted.sql first. Same two rules, same reasons:
--   1. A custom AA with a NEW id never reaches the client (ability > 30195, rank > 65535).
--   2. Rank ids are NOT contiguous -- follow first_rank_id then next_id. Every chain below was
--      walked, not assumed, and the activated hosts are the worst offenders: Cannibalization runs
--      146 - 5069 - 6102 - 7466 - 7691. Terminate with next_id = -1.
--
-- ⚠️ type = 4 puts these on the tab labelled "Melee" in EQUI_AAWindow.xml.
--
--   host 30  Combat Fury                 ranks 113,114,115,443,444    -> Sunder           [MARKER]
--   host 19  Healing Gift                ranks  80, 81, 82,437,438    -> Killing Rhythm   [MARKER]
--   host 21  Spell Casting Reinforcement ranks  86, 87, 88,266,10467  -> Relentless       [native SPA]
--   host 25  Spell Casting Subtlety      ranks  98, 99,100,4767,4768  -> Bloodletting     [MARKER]
--   host 16  Innate Lung Capacity        ranks  71, 72, 73,676,677    -> Executioner      [MARKER]
--   host 47  Cannibalization             ranks 146,5069,6102,7466,7691-> Sanguine Frenzy  [ACTIVATED]
--
-- That is six more native abilities consumed, sixteen across the three trees. All are disabled
-- server-wide today, so nothing is lost now, but each is gone if the native set is turned back on.
--
-- ⚠️ MARKER RANK IDS -- 113, 80, 86, 98, 71, 146 -- are the ONLY join to zone/aotv4_melee_aa.cpp and
-- nothing checks them. A wrong id reads rank 0 forever: the AA looks bought and does nothing.
--
-- =============================================================================================
-- SANGUINE FRENZY IS AN ACTIVATED AA. Three requirements, all enforced by
-- Client::ActivateAlternateAdvancementAbility:
--
--   a. It MUST have a valid spell (IsValidSpell(rank->spell)) -- 43405 from aotv4_melee_buffs.sql.
--   b. It MUST have NO aa_rank_effects. The function returns early on a rank with effects, since
--      that is how it tells a passive from an activated one. Every marker AA already satisfies this.
--   c. recast_time is in SECONDS -- 45.
--
-- ⚠️ spell_type IS A TIMER SLOT, NOT A CATEGORY. The cooldown is keyed on
-- `rank->spell_type + pTimerAAStart`, so two activated AAs sharing a spell_type SHARE a cooldown.
-- This is the only activated AA we enable, so slot 2 (inherited from Cannibalization) is safe --
-- but any future activated AA must take a different one.
--
-- The host is used because it already has upper/lower hotkey sids set, which is what lets the
-- ability be dragged to a hotbar. A passive host has -1 there and cannot be activated at all.

-- All three PASSIVE, all three markers -- the behaviour is in zone/aotv4_melee_aa.cpp and rank ids
-- 247, 210 and 255 are the ONLY join. Chains walked; title_sid and desc_sid confirmed equal to
-- first_rank_id on all three (the trap that made Overload show Quick Damage's description).
--
-- ⚠️ NONE OF THESE IS A STUN OR A PROC, deliberately. Stuns are already reachable through the spell
-- and combat-ability rewards, and weapon procs already carry a great deal of this server's power
-- budget. These three add reach into situations nothing else covers.

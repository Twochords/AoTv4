--
-- ⚠️⚠️ TIMER SLOTS. spell_type is a TIMER SLOT: two activated AAs sharing one share a cooldown.
-- Now in use: 2 Sanguine Frenzy, 3 Second Wind, 4 Reprieve, 6 Sanctified Blow, 8 Fade,
-- 12 Last Stand, 14 Iron Will, 20 Rally, 37 Disengage. War Cry ships on 3 and is MOVED to 20.
--
-- ⚠️ WHY 45 MINUTES AND NOT AN ENDURANCE COST ALONE. Endurance regenerates in minutes, so on a
-- long timer the cost by itself is decorative. What makes it a decision is that the same resource
-- funds Iron Will and Second Wind -- spend it and your emergency exit is disarmed until it returns.
-- The code requires 50 percent of maximum endurance as well as consuming it.
--
-- ⚠️ Recast timers are PERSISTENT (p_timers.Store/Load), so camping or zoning cannot reset one.
